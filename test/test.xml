			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Politics, Media, Popular Culture</strong><br />
In this course, we will examine U.S. politics and popular culture in the period 1941-2015. We will analyze political films ranging from the World War II propaganda series, <em>Why We Fight</em>, to more recent feature films such as <em>Wag the Dog</em> and <em>Good Night and Good Luck</em>.  We will consider television’s impact on civic culture, focusing on entertainment programs (<em>I Led 3 Lives</em>, <em>24</em>, <em>Scandal</em>), the news (<em>See It Now</em>, <em>The O’Reilly Factor</em>), campaign commercials, and political satire (<em>The Daily Show</em>, <em>The Colbert Report</em>). Finally, we will assess how online organizing and the blogosphere impact civic participation. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Black Comic Cultures</strong><br />
In this course we will explore a range of black comic cultures, analyzing their emergence and transformation from the early 20th century to the present. Specifically, we will examine blackface minstrels of the early 20th century such as George Walker and Bert Williams, Bill Cosby’s performances in the 60s, and the ribald humor of LaWanda Page’s 1970s party records, before moving to the urban scene embodied in television shows such as <em>Def Comedy Jam</em>. We will also engage with theoretical materials that help us analyze black comedy as multidimensional, such as John Limon’s <em>Stand-up Comedy in Theory</em>, or, <em>Abjection in America</em>. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

A study of literary and other cultural forms in early America, including gravestones, architecture, furniture and visual art.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>See the U.S.A.: The History of Tourism in American Culture</strong><br />
In this course, we will explore the history and evolution of American tourism, beginning in the 1820s, when middle-class tourists first journeyed up the Hudson River valley, and ending with our contemporary and continuing obsession with iconic destinations such as Graceland, Gettysburg, and the Grand Canyon. We will explore how the growth of national transportation systems, the development of advertising, and the rise of a middle class with money and time to spend on leisure shaped the evolution of tourism.  Along the way, we will study various types of tourism (such as historical, cultural, ethnic, eco-, and 'disaster' tourism) and look at the creative processes by which places are transformed into 'destinations'.  Our texts will come from visual art, travel literature, material culture, and film and television.  We will consider their cultural meaning and reflect on our own motivations and responses as tourists, and by so doing contemplate why tourism was-and still is-such an important part of American life. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sexuality in the United States: Histories and Identities</strong><br />
What does sexuality mean? In the United States the meanings of sexuality are highly contested, historically and in the present. Working from an interdisciplinary perspective, we will look at different historical and theoretical approaches to thinking about issues of sexuality and to writing its histories. Drawing from feminist scholarship, queer theory, and lesbian, gay, and transgender studies, we will discuss sexual identities, representations of sexuality, and sexual cultures, and examine how intersecting categories such as race, class, disability, and gender influence how sexuality is understood. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Black Archives</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the archives of black thinkers such as Ralph Ellison, Robert Lynch, Claude McKay, Toni Morrison, Kara Walker, and Richard Wright. We will read rejected and lost manuscripts, unpublished drafts and notes, photographs, and complete diaries and novels that have never been read by the public but instead relegated to the archive. By recovering these lost texts, we will engage in activism by unsilencing these silenced black texts. To accomplish this task, students will manage a hardcopy archive and curate a digital archive. Topics will include diaspora and representation, personal and collective memory, gender and disability studies, and theories of the archive. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

In this course we will examine the history, meanings, and realities of disability in the United States. We will analyze the social, political, economic, environmental, and material factors that shape the meanings of "disability," examining changes and continuities over time. Students will draw critical attention to the connections between disability, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and age in American and transnational contexts. Diverse sources, including films and television shows, music, advertising, fiction, memoirs, and material objects, encourage inter and multi-disciplinary approaches to disability. Central themes we consider include language, privilege, community, citizenship, education, medicine and technology, and representation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Across the Great Divide:  Science, Humanities, and the American Landscape</strong><br />
The American landscape encompasses a diversity of built and natural environments. In this course, we will survey 200 years of history, using the tools of science and the humanities to understand how people have changed the landscape and how the landscape has shaped its human inhabitants. We will read historical, literary, and scientific works—and employ a variety of archival and aesthetic materials—to explore moments of transformation within four geographic regions: New England, the Midwest, the West, and the South. In so doing, we will arrive at an understanding of the interdependency of cultural and ecological history and the intersections between scientific and humanistic modes of inquiry. Readings will emphasize primary texts, and will include writings by Harriett Beecher Stowe, George Perkins Marsh, and photography by Dorothea Lange and others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Issues in Critical Disability Studies: U.S. and the World</strong><br />
Disability as a category and as lived experience plays an important but often overlooked role in national, transnational, and global contexts. In this course we will explore disability’s changing meanings in the United States and around the World. Comparative and transnational approaches will draw our attention to disability’s many meanings across wide-ranging historical, cultural, and geographical settings. Foundational concepts and principles, including ableism and Universal Design, shape our critical inquiry. Key themes frame the course: access, language, power, violence, normalcy, identity, community, institutions, and rights and justice. We will engage with diverse primary sources, from memoirs and documentary films to advertisements, material objects, and oral histories.]]></description>

In this course we will study both black and white writers' psychological responses to, and their verbal onslaughts on, the "peculiar institution" of chattel slavery.  We will work chronologically and across genres to understand how and by whom the written word was deployed in pursuit of physical and mental freedom and racial and socioeconomic justice. As the course progresses, we will deepen our study of historical context drawing on the substantial resources of Middlebury's special collections, students will have the opportunity to engage in archival work if they wish.  Authors will include Emerson, Douglass, Jacobs, Thoreau, Stowe, Walker, and Garrison. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

Although generally regarded as a popular painter of American life, Winslow Homer often provides a penetrating and sometimes disturbing view of post-Civil War America. Among the topics to be considered: Homer's paintings of the Civil War; his illustrations of leisure and recreation; and his depictions of women and children in the Gilded Age. During the second half of the course, we will turn our attention to Homer's landscape paintings of the Adirondacks, the Caribbean and the Maine coast, as well as his seascapes of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic.  3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Arabic Novel in Translation</strong><br />
In this course we will discuss various forms of Arabic literary prose from the end of the 19th century to the present. The course traces the rise of prose forms such as memoirs and travel journals that later developed into the novel form with prominent writers such as Yahya Haqqi, Naguib Mahfouz, and Tayyib Salih. The focus will be to study the manner in which the novel reflects major changes and transitions in Arab culture and society.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Human-Environment Relations: Middle East</strong><br />
In this course we will begin with an environmental history of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, asking such questions as: How does politics affect conservation practice? To what extent are formulations of nature constructed socially and politically? Whose rights are affected by protected areas and who decides governance criteria? The objectives of this course include providing students with an understanding of human-environment relations theory by addressing the regional specifics of modern environmental and social histories of these countries. We will look at animals, water, and forests in the literature of NGOs, UNEP reports, media, policy papers, and the academic literature. (One of the following: ENVS 0112, GEOG 0100, IGST 0101, SOAN 0103; Or by approval) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Creative Process</strong><br />
In this course, students will have the opportunity to dig deeply into their own creativity and explore the processes by which ideas emerge and are given shape in the arts. The experiential nature of this course integrates cognition and action, mind and body.  Students will engage a range of modes of discovering, knowing, and communicating, which are designed to push them beyond their present state of awareness and level of confidence in their creative power.  Practical work will be closely accompanied by readings and journaling, culminating with the creation and performance of a short project. (First- and second-year students only; Not open to students who have taken FYSE 1364) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sculptural Architecture</strong><br />
Architecture is a projection of our dreams as well as a practical necessity. In this course we will explore making architecture as imaginative sculpture. Working on a table-top scale, we will draw, build, and digitally photograph structures confronting challenges of site, population, and aesthetics. Specific and useful skills, such as hand and power tool operation, will be taught. Students will learn how to make sophisticated three-dimensional forms using foam-core, balsa, mahogany, and other woods. In addition, unusual processes of flame-worked and fused glass will be introduced. Weekly image-lectures on the history of sculpture, design, and architecture will be included. This class is recommended for those interested in bridging architectural practice with studio art freedom. No experience is required or expected. 6 hrs. lect./lab <br />

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Landscape Re-Imagined: Painting, Drawing, Photography, and Glass</strong><br />
In this course we will explore various art-making methods to depict our campus landscape and architecture. We will use oil paint on canvas, color drawing media, photography, and kiln-fused glass in a multi-disciplinary approach to two-dimensional picture-making. We will then explore how to integrate these technical processes with a goal of creating new and contemporary painted images. In addition to weekly image-based lectures on the history of landscape painting, the class will involve a collaborative studio workshop atmosphere, close individual instruction, and personal artistic development.  (ART 0157, ART 0158, ART 0159 or by approval) 6 hrs. lect./lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Black & White Darkroom</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the foundational theories and methods of black & white photography, and be given the opportunity to apply these theories and methods in  darkroom projects. We will learn how to expose, develop, and print black & white film. We will also consider the history of photography and its evolution from traditional to contemporary practices. Student work will be guided by slide lectures, weekly assignments, and peer critiques. (ART 0157 or ART 0159 or ART 1026 or ART 1125 or by approval) 3 hrs. lect/3 lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sculpture I - Communicating in Three-Dimensions</strong><br />
This course is designed to further an investigation into the techniques and principles of three-dimensional art. Project objectives are designed to provide new problems and techniques to provoke creative solutions and visions. We will experiment with a number of materials and concepts, from wood-bending and welding to performance and installation. Each project's success will rely heavily on the research and commitment students bring to the creative process.  Students will be expected to communicate the process and concept behind each artwork visually, orally, and in writing. (ART 0159 and another introductory level studio practice course from the following list: ART 0157, ART 0159, ART 0180, or by approval) 6 hrs. lect.lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Ecology and Evolution</strong><br />
In this introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology we will cover the topics of interspecific interactions (competition, predation, mutualism), demography and life-history patterns, succession and disturbance in natural communities, species diversity, stability and complexity, causes of evolutionary change, speciation, phylogenetic reconstruction, and population genetics.   The laboratory component will examine lecture topics in detail (such as measuring the evolutionary response of bacteria, adaptations of stream invertebrates to life in moving water, invasive species and their patterns of spread).  We will emphasize experimental design, data collection in the field and in the laboratory, data analysis, and writing skills. This course is not open to seniors and second semester juniors in the Fall. 3 hrs. lect./disc./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Ecology and Evolution</strong><br />
In this introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology we will cover the topics of interspecific interactions (competition, predation, mutualism), demography and life-history patterns, succession and disturbance in natural communities, species diversity, stability and complexity, causes of evolutionary change, speciation, phylogenetic reconstruction, and population genetics.   The laboratory component will examine lecture topics in detail (such as measuring the evolutionary response of bacteria, adaptations of stream invertebrates to life in moving water, invasive species and their patterns of spread).  We will emphasize experimental design, data collection in the field and in the laboratory, data analysis, and writing skills. This course is not open to seniors and second semester juniors in the Fall. 3 hrs. lect./disc./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

In this introduction to modern cellular, genetic, and molecular biology we will explore life science concepts with an emphasis on their integral nature and evolutionary relationships.  Topics covered will include cell membrane structure and function, metabolism, cell motility and division, genome structure and replication, the regulation of gene expression and protein production, genotype to phenotype relationship, and basic principles of inheritance.  Major concepts will be illustrated using a broad range of examples from plants, animals, and microorganisms.  Current topics in biology will be integrated into the course as they arise.  3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

In this introduction to modern cellular, genetic, and molecular biology we will explore life science concepts with an emphasis on their integral nature and evolutionary relationships.  Topics covered will include cell membrane structure and function, metabolism, cell motility and division, genome structure and replication, the regulation of gene expression and protein production, genotype to phenotype relationship, and basic principles of inheritance.  Major concepts will be illustrated using a broad range of examples from plants, animals, and microorganisms.  Current topics in biology will be integrated into the course as they arise.  3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

In this introduction to modern cellular, genetic, and molecular biology we will explore life science concepts with an emphasis on their integral nature and evolutionary relationships.  Topics covered will include cell membrane structure and function, metabolism, cell motility and division, genome structure and replication, the regulation of gene expression and protein production, genotype to phenotype relationship, and basic principles of inheritance.  Major concepts will be illustrated using a broad range of examples from plants, animals, and microorganisms.  Current topics in biology will be integrated into the course as they arise.  3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Invertebrate Biology</strong><br />
The study of invertebrate animals, which comprise more than 90 percent of all animal species and represent the most diverse approaches to life on earth. A wide variety of protozoans cnidarians, echinoderms, mollusks, crustaceans, arachnids and insects are examined. Animals are studied primarily in the field for the first half of the course and the lab in the second. Emphasis is upon their ecology, evolution, behavior, and taxonomy. Specialized topics include regeneration, parasitology, sociality, and adaptations to freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Oral, written, and independent projects are required.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Biology of Plants</strong><br />
An introduction to plants, their life cycles, and their relationships to each other, as well as to the animals that pollinate them, disperse their fruits, and eat them. We will discuss morphology, physiology, evolution, and natural history of plants (mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms). The laboratory will emphasize plant identification, various aspects of plant ecology and physiology, plant morphology, and plant use by humans.  Students will complete a Community Service component, such as completing a forest inventory for a local forest, assisting with the campus tree map, or help with seed-saving measures at the College Organic Garden.  Field trips will be the norm early in the semester. (BIOL 0140 and BIOL 0145) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Vertebrate Natural History</strong><br />
This course deals with the natural history of vertebrates in the context of the forests, fields, wetlands, and rivers of western Vermont. We will explore in depth the taxonomy of the local vertebrate fauna; techniques for capturing and handling live animals, particularly birds, mammals, and fish; and address experimentally specific questions about the distribution and abundance of vertebrates in a range of natural plant communities. Topics considered will include conservation biology, population and community ecology, and behavior. Field work will involve several early morning and weekend trips.

This field course will introduce students to the freshwater aquatic ecosystems of the northeastern U.S., including lakes, streams, rivers, and wetlands. We will explore the ecological processes that dominate these systems, the organisms that inhabit them, and the ecological techniques central to their study. Field exercises will include trips to many aquatic ecosystems in the region; experience with sampling techniques for measurement of physical, chemical, and biological features; and experimental design for answering questions about the relationships among species and between species and their environment.

The microbiological principles emphasized in this class will provide students with a foundation for advanced study in many areas of contemporary biology. The course will integrate basic and applied aspects of microbiology into a study of the prokaryotic microorganisms. General principles of bacterial cell structure, function, and the role of microorganisms in industry, agriculture, biotechnology, and disease will be discussed. An independent laboratory project will stress basic microbiological techniques as applied to the isolation, characterization, and identification of microorganisms from the natural environment. (BIOL 0140 and BIOL 0145 and CHEM 0203) 3 hrs. lect./4 hrs. lab./1 hr. prelab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Molecular Microbial Ecology</strong><br />
Molecular microbial ecology (MME) uses leading-edge molecular tools to study the interactions and diversity of microorganisms in the natural environment. MME covers topics ranging from ancient polar microbes, the human microbiome, and the possibility of life beyond Earth.  In this course we will discuss papers that highlight modern technical approaches and form the current theoretical framework in microbial ecology. The laboratory will examine the structure (”Who is there?”) and function (”What are they doing?”) of microbial communities in environmental samples. We will cultivate novel microorganisms and analyze nucleic acids via community fingerprinting, functional gene analysis, and the computational exploration of metagenomic datasets.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Animal Physiology</strong><br />
This course examines the body functions of animals and humans using general physiological principles and a comparative approach. Lectures will cover the function of each of the major physiological systems (nervous, endocrine, muscular, etc.) and will describe how animal physiology has been shaped by evolution to allow animals to survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Lectures will focus mainly on physiological processes occurring at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Occasional journal article discussions will provide case studies of current topics in animal physiology. Laboratory exercises, reports and oral presentations emphasize experimental design, analysis and independent study using various methodological approaches including electrophysiology, neurotransmitter manipulations, nutritional analysis, and exercise physiology. (BIOL 0145 and BIOL 0140 or BIOL 0216). 3 hrs. lect/3 hrs. lab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Animal Physiology</strong><br />
This course examines the body functions of animals and humans using general physiological principles and a comparative approach. Lectures will cover the function of each of the major physiological systems (nervous, endocrine, muscular, etc.) and will describe how animal physiology has been shaped by evolution to allow animals to survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Lectures will focus mainly on physiological processes occurring at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Occasional journal article discussions will provide case studies of current topics in animal physiology. Laboratory exercises, reports and oral presentations emphasize experimental design, analysis and independent study using various methodological approaches including electrophysiology, neurotransmitter manipulations, nutritional analysis, and exercise physiology. (BIOL 0145 and BIOL 0140 or BIOL 0216). 3 hrs. lect/3 hrs. lab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Organic Chemistry I: Structure and Reactivity</strong><br />
This course will provide students with an introduction to the structure and reactivity of organic molecules sufficient to continue directly to study of biochemistry (CHEM 0322). Topics covered will include models of chemical bonding, acid-base relationships, three-dimensional molecular structure (conformations and stereochemistry), reaction mechanisms and energy diagrams, substitution and elimination reactions, carbonyl reactions (additions, reductions, interconversions, and alpha-reactivity), and the fundamentals of biological molecules (carbohydrates, DNA, and RNA). Laboratory experiments will include purification techniques (recrystallization, distillation, extraction, and chromatography) as well as microscale organic reactions that complement the lecture portion of the course. (CHEM 0104 or CHEM 0107)  3 hrs. lect., 3 hrs. lab, 1 hr. prelab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Organic Chemistry I: Structure and Reactivity</strong><br />
This course will provide students with an introduction to the structure and reactivity of organic molecules sufficient to continue directly to study of biochemistry (CHEM 0322). Topics covered will include models of chemical bonding, acid-base relationships, three-dimensional molecular structure (conformations and stereochemistry), reaction mechanisms and energy diagrams, substitution and elimination reactions, carbonyl reactions (additions, reductions, interconversions, and alpha-reactivity), and the fundamentals of biological molecules (carbohydrates, DNA, and RNA). Laboratory experiments will include purification techniques (recrystallization, distillation, extraction, and chromatography) as well as microscale organic reactions that complement the lecture portion of the course. (CHEM 0104 or CHEM 0107)  3 hrs. lect., 3 hrs. lab, 1 hr. prelab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Organic Chemistry II: Synthesis and Spectroscopy</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the ways that organic molecules are made and their structures identified. The study of organic reactions will continue from CHEM 0203 with radical reactions, alkene and alkyne additions, aromatic reactions, oxidations and reductions, and additional carbonyl reactions. Emphasis in this course will be placed on using reactions in sequences to synthesize larger and more complex molecules. The theory and practice of mass spectrometry and UV-Vis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy will be studied as a means to elucidate the exact structures of organic molecules. Laboratory experiments will focus on synthetic techniques that complement the lecture portion of the course and the identification of complex unknowns via GC-MS, IR, and NMR. (CHEM 0203) 3 hrs. lect., 3 hrs. lab, 1 hr. prelab.]]></description>

This course introduces fundamental concepts of analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and scientific writing. Lecture topics include experimental design and quality control; sample collection and preparation; calibration, error, and data analysis; statistics; and the theory and operation of chemical instrumentation. Multi-week laboratory projects provide hands-on experience in qualitative and quantitative analysis using a variety of research-quality instrumentation (e.g., graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectrometry, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, high pressure liquid chromatography). Writing workshops promote professional scientific writing skills through guided practice in writing analysis, peer review, and revision.

This course is an introduction to biochemistry that focuses on the chemical and physical properties of amino acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.  Specific topics include the structure and function of proteins, enzyme mechanisms and kinetics, how carbohydrates and lipids contribute to vital cellular and organismal functions, and informational biochemistry (DNA, RNA, and specific enzymes and processes leading to the production of regulatory RNA and proteins).  Specific topics from the primary literature will be explored to illustrate how particular techniques and experimental approaches are used to gain a new understanding of biochemistry and molecular biology.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar in Chemical Research</strong><br />
This seminar provides students with experiences to support the preparation of a senior thesis. As the course involves participation in a mentored laboratory project and the intent to complete a senior thesis, students must make arrangements to work with a faculty advisor prior to gaining approval for course registration. The classroom portion of this seminar focuses on reading the scientific literature, giving effective oral presentations, and writing the thesis introduction. Particular emphasis will be given to computer and technology issues related to oral and written presentations. Participation will normally be followed by registration for CHEM 0500 or CHEM 0700 (winter term and spring). (Senior standing; Approval only) 2 hrs. sem., 12 hrs. lab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Biochemistry of Metabolism</strong><br />
A living organism requires thousands of coordinated individual chemical reactions for life.  In this course we will survey the major integrated metabolic pathways of living cells and whole organisms, with particular attention to enzyme mechanisms, as well as the regulation, and integration of metabolism from the molecular to the whole organism level. The synthesis and degradation of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides are investigated, along with the mechanisms of energy flow and cell-to-cell communication.   While common metabolic processes are emphasized, unique aspects of metabolism that permit cells to function in unusual niches will also be considered.  Mechanistic and regulatory aspects of metabolic processes will be reinforced through an investigation of inborn errors and organic defects that lead to disease.  (CHEM 0322) 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

This course is an introduction to Mandarin (guoyu or putonghua). The course begins with simple words and phrases, the pronunciation and cadences of Mandarin, romanization, Chinese characters, and simple vocabulary items, all taught in the context of practical communication. Sentence patterns and other fundamentals of speaking, reading, and writing will be taught, including both traditional characters (used everywhere before the 1950s and still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong) and simplified characters (used in China). Students should have achieved active command of more than 600 Chinese characters and more than 800 compounds by the end of the sequence CHNS 0101, CHNS 0102, and CHNS 0103. 5 hrs. lect., 2 hrs. drill]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Chinese Literary Tradition (in translation)</strong><br />
This course, an introduction to the works of literature that formed the basis of traditional Chinese culture, is a discussion-based seminar. It focuses first on texts written in classical Chinese from the earliest times up through the Song dynasty, including selections from early poetry and history, Daoist classics, stories of the strange, and Tang Dynasty poetry by Wang Wei, Li Bai and Du Fu. These texts shaped the traditional Chinese understanding of the world, and provided models of what was perceived to be powerful, beautiful language.  In the second part of the course we will explore narratives written in the vernacular language, focusing on the literary significance and aesthetic value of drama, stories and novels long treasured by the Chinese. Students will gain a better understanding of traditional Chinese literary values, as well as Chinese society and worldviews. This class is not intended for native Chinese students who have studied Chinese literature in high school classes in China. (No background in Chinese culture or language needed.) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Modern China through Literature (in translation)</strong><br />
This course, taught in English, is a discussion-based seminar on some of the most significant works of short fiction, novellas, and novels that tell the story of China and the Chinese from the end of the Qing dynasty to the present. Students will gain a better understanding of the history of modern China by studying the works of literature that inspired readers and provoked debate during one hundred years of social reform, revolution, war, civil war, reconstruction, cultural revolution, cultural revival, and economic growth. Our reading will include work by authors such as Lu Xun (<em>Diary of a Madman</em>, 1918), Zhang Ailing (<em>Love in a Fallen City</em>, 1944), Ah Cheng (<em>The Chess King</em>, 1984), Yu Hua (<em>To Live</em>, 1993), and, from Taiwan, Zhu Tianwen (<em>Notes of a Desolate Man</em>, 1999). We will consider the mainstream (socially engaged realism), the avant-garde (varieties of modernism), and popular genres (romance and martial arts), and we will look for answers to the following questions: what has been the place of fiction in China in the modern era and what vision of modern China do we find in its fiction? (No prerequisites) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Chinese Sociolinguistics (taught in English)</strong><br />
Sociolinguistics is mainly concerned with the interaction of language and society. The language situation in China is unique both in the modern world and in human history. We will gain a good understanding of sociolinguistics as a scientific field of inquiry through exploring the Chinese situation in this course. Some of the questions we will ask are: What is Mandarin (Modern Standard) Chinese? Who are "native speakers" of Mandarin? Are most Chinese people monolingual (speaking only one language) or bilingual (speaking two languages) or even multilingual? How many "dialects" are there in China? What is the difference between a "language" and a "dialect"? Are Chinese characters "ideographs", i.e., "pictures" that directly represent meaning and have nothing to do with sound? Why has the pinyin romanization system officially adopted in the 1950s never supplanted the Chinese characters? Why are there traditional and simplified characters? We will also explore topics such as power, register, verbal courtesy, gender and language use. Students are encouraged to compare the Chinese situation with societies that they are familiar with. (One semester of Chinese language study or by waiver)]]></description>

In China since the 1980s, new political and socio-economic realities, along with new technologies, created conditions for the emergence of the New Documentary Movement, the collective achievement of a group of artists with new ideas about what the form and function of nonfiction film should be. We will screen and discuss select contemporary Chinese documentary films, place these films in the context of global documentary film history, and learn methods for the analysis of nonfiction film. We will “read” each film closely, and also study secondary sources to learn about the Chinese realities that each film documents. 3 hrs. lect./screening]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Traditional Chinese Novels (in translation)</strong><br />
This seminar focuses on pre-modern Chinese full-length novels, which rose and matured during the Ming-Qing period. Students will read the "masterworks" of this genre, including <em>Three Kingdoms</em> (the epic deeds of heroes of the Chinese civil war of the second and third centuries), <em>Outlaws of the Marsh</em> (picaresque tales of Chinese Robin Hoods, as it were), <em>The Journey to the West</em> (a comic Buddhist-Daoist allegory better known in English as <em>Monkey</em>), <em>The Plum in the Golden Vase</em> (an erotic novel of manners), <em>The Scholars</em> (a social satire), and <em>The Story of the Stone-The Dream of the Red Chamber</em> (widely recognized as a masterpiece of world literature); all are beloved and long treasured by the Chinese. We will not only trace the evolution of classical Chinese novels and consider their literary significance and artistic value; the course will also aim to provide a richer and deeper understanding of traditional China, her history, society, culture, worldviews, beliefs, sense of humor, etc. (CHNS 0219, CHNS 0220, or CHNS 0250, or two Middlebury literature courses, or by approval of the instructor. CHNS 0219 strongly recommended.)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Traditional Chinese Novels (in translation)</strong><br />
This seminar focuses on pre-modern Chinese full-length novels, which rose and matured during the Ming-Qing period. Students will read the "masterworks" of this genre, including <em>Three Kingdoms</em> (the epic deeds of heroes of the Chinese civil war of the second and third centuries), <em>Outlaws of the Marsh</em> (picaresque tales of Chinese Robin Hoods, as it were), <em>The Journey to the West</em> (a comic Buddhist-Daoist allegory better known in English as <em>Monkey</em>), <em>The Plum in the Golden Vase</em> (an erotic novel of manners), <em>The Scholars</em> (a social satire), and <em>The Story of the Stone-The Dream of the Red Chamber</em> (widely recognized as a masterpiece of world literature); all are beloved and long treasured by the Chinese. We will not only trace the evolution of classical Chinese novels and consider their literary significance and artistic value; the course will also aim to provide a richer and deeper understanding of traditional China, her history, society, culture, worldviews, beliefs, sense of humor, etc. (CHNS 0219, CHNS 0220, or CHNS 0250, or two Middlebury literature courses, or by approval of the instructor. CHNS 0219 strongly recommended.)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Classical Chinese I (in Chinese)</strong><br />
This course is an introduction to wenyan, the written language of traditional China. In this course we will emphasize comprehension of the literal and metaphorical meanings of short <em>wenyan</em> texts. Our approach will include grammatical analysis and <em>baihua</em> translation (i.e., from the Classical Chinese into modern Chinese); discussion will be conducted entirely in <em>baihua</em>. This course begins the two-semester sequence of Classical Chinese, which not only introduces students to <em>wenyan</em> but also provides a vital learning experience for any student seeking to attain a high level of linguistic and cultural proficiency in Chinese, including modern written discourse.

Would Achilles and Hector have risked their lives and sacred honor had they understood human life and the Olympian gods as Homer portrays them in the <em>Iliad</em>? Why do those gods decide to withdraw from men altogether following the Trojan War, and why is Odysseus the man Athena chooses to help her carry out that project? And why, according to the Roman poet Vergil, do these gods command Aeneas, a defeated Trojan, to found an Italian town that will ultimately conquer the Greek cities that conquered Troy, replacing the Greek polis with a universal empire that will end all wars of human freedom? Through close study of Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, and Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>, we explore how the epic tradition helped shape Greece and Rome, and define their contributions to European civilization. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Myth and Contemporary Experience: Modern Poems on Classical Myths</strong><br />
Greek mythology, an enduring presence in Western thought, has provided, according to Carl Jung, the foundation of one half of our spiritual tradition. In this course we shall study how this rich mythical material has shaped modern poetry. Through close readings of modern poems and their ancient models, we will trace the way 20th-century poets appropriate and transform the classical past in order to reflect on their historical present. While viewing this function of myth as an element of modernity, we shall also explore how these poets build connections between the archetypal meaning of the ancient stories, the questions of existence, and our own contemporary lives. Readings will include Rilke, Eliot, Pound, Cavafy, Montale, Akhmatova, Borges, as well as Sylvia Plath, Joseph Brodsky, Derek Walcott, Louise Glück, and Seamus Heaney. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Cities of Vesuvius</strong><br />
The Bay of Naples was an international cultural crossroads in antiquity. Prominent in Classical mythology and first colonized by the Greeks at Cumae and Neapolis, the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Baiae later flourished there, favored by the rich and powerful. We will study the history, arts, politics, religion, and commerce of these various cities, 800 BCE - 100 CE. Readings will include ancient authors in translation and secondary sources. The environment (geology, seismology) will receive special emphasis as it led to the cataclysmic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE, which doomed Pompeii and altered the landscape forever.  3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Greek and Roman Epic Poetry</strong><br />
Would Achilles and Hector have risked their lives and sacred honor had they understood human life and the Olympian gods as Homer portrays them in the <em>Iliad</em>? Why do those gods decide to withdraw from men altogether following the Trojan War, and why is Odysseus the man Athena chooses to help her carry out that project? And why, according to the Roman poet Vergil, do these gods command Aeneas, a defeated Trojan, to found an Italian town that will ultimately conquer the Greek cities that conquered Troy, replacing the Greek polis with a universal empire that will end all wars of human freedom? Through close study of Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, and Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>, we explore how the epic tradition helped shape Greece and Rome, and define their contributions to European civilization. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Contemporary Literary Theory</strong><br />
This course will introduce several major schools of contemporary literary theory. By reading theoretical texts in close conjunction with works of literature, we will illuminate the ways in which these theoretical stances can produce various interpretations of a given poem, novel, or play. The approaches covered will include New Criticism, Psychoanalysis, Marxism and Cultural Criticism, Feminism, and Post-Structuralism. These theories will be applied to works by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, The Brontës, Conrad, Joyce, and others. The goal will be to make students critically aware of the fundamental literary, cultural, political, and moral assumptions underlying every act of interpretation they perform.  3 hrs. lect/disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Arabic Novel in Translation</strong><br />
In this course we will discuss various forms of Arabic literary prose from the end of the 19th century to the present. The course traces the rise of prose forms such as memoirs and travel journals that later developed into the novel form with prominent writers such as Yahya Haqqi, Naguib Mahfouz, and Tayyib Salih. The focus will be to study the manner in which the novel reflects major changes and transitions in Arab culture and society.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ Myth and Contemporary Experience: Modern Poems on Classical Myths*<br />
Greek mythology, an enduring presence in Western thought, has provided, according to Carl Jung, the foundation of one half of our spiritual tradition. In this course we shall study how this rich mythical material has shaped modern poetry. Through close readings of modern poems and their ancient models, we will trace the way 20th-century poets appropriate and transform the classical past in order to reflect on their historical present. While viewing this function of myth as an element of modernity, we shall also explore how these poets build connections between the archetypal meaning of the ancient stories, the questions of existence, and our own contemporary lives. Readings will include Rilke, Eliot, Pound, Cavafy, Montale, Akhmatova, Borges, as well as Sylvia Plath, Joseph Brodsky, Derek Walcott, Louise Glück, and Seamus Heaney. 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Philosophy & Literature</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the border both separating and joining philosophy and literature. How does literature evoke philosophical problems, and how do philosophers interpret such works? How does fiction create meaning? Beginning with Greek tragedy, we investigate Plato’s “quarrel” with, and Aristotle’s defense of, poetry. Then we will turn to modern works, mostly European, on topics such as: tragedy and ethics; style and rhetoric; author and reader; time and temporality; mood and emotion; existence and mortality. Literary readings after Sophocles will be selected from Borges, Calvino, Camus, Kafka, Tolstoy, and Woolf.  Philosophical readings after Plato and Aristotle will be selected from Bergson, Danto, Freud, Murdoch, Ricoeur, and Nussbaum. Not open to students who have taken PHIL/CMLT 1014.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>From Deviance to Discipline: A Cultural History of the Body in Late 19th and Early 20th Century Western Europe</strong><br />
In this course students will explore varying modes of constructing the body—the diseased body, the criminal body, the racialized body, the machine body, and more—in late 19th  and early 20th century Western Europe.  Readings will be framed against the tumultuous historical backdrop of this period, characterized by technological and scientific innovation, the explosive rise of consumer culture, the so-called “scramble for Africa,” and two ravaging world wars.  In order to understand the body as a cultural artifact students will closely examine literary, medical, political, and visual primary texts and will draw on secondary materials from such diverse fields as literary criticism, social history, cultural anthropology, and cultural theory. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Municipal Fictions</strong><br />
In this course we will explore colonial and postcolonial municipal spaces in the literatures of the global South. Municipal spaces are often imagined as places where nothing happens. But municipality and/or small urbanisms have been represented from the 19th through the 21st centuries in canonical, popular, and pulp fictions as well as visual cultures and genres. Close reading of texts by Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Linh Dinh, Premchand, Mongo Beti, Bama, and Tamil pulp fiction reveal the intrigues, entanglements, and encroachments of modernity. Theoretical readings include critical theory of place and postcolonial theory. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Novel and the City</strong><br />
In this course we will examine a number of novels from the 20th and 21st centuries that are about life in the city, taking a global and trans-national approach.  We will explore formations of urban life alongside transformations in the novel as a genre.  We will put these novels of city life in dialogue with critical theory—that is, theories of culture and society that have as their aim human emancipation (for example, Marxism, feminism, critical race studies, and postcolonial studies).  The novels we read will reflect important literary movements such as realism, modernism, and postmodernism.  (Not open to students who have taken ENAM 0447)]]></description>

In this course we will examine the fundamental elements of dramatic narrative as they relate to visual storytelling. We will emphasize the process of generating original story material and learning the craft of screenwriting, including topics such as story, outline, scene structure, subtext, character objectives, formatting standards, and narrative strategies. Weekly writing assignments will emphasize visual storytelling techniques, tone and atmosphere, character relationships, and dialogue. Students will be required to complete two short screenplays. Required readings will inform and accompany close study of selected screenplays and films. (FMMC 0101 OR CRWR 0170 or approval of instructor) (Formerly FMMC/ENAM 0106) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this course we will provide a broad introductory overview of the discipline of computer science, with no prerequisites or assumed prior knowledge of computers or programming. A significant component of the course is an introduction to algorithmic concepts and to programming using Python; programming assignments will explore algorithmic strategies such as selection, iteration, divide-and-conquer, and recursion, as well as introducing the Python programming language. Additional topics will include: the structure and organization of computers, the Internet and World Wide Web, abstraction as a means of managing complexity, social and ethical computing issues, and the question "What is computation?"

In this course we will provide a broad introductory overview of the discipline of computer science, with no prerequisites or assumed prior knowledge of computers or programming. A significant component of the course is an introduction to algorithmic concepts and to programming using Python; programming assignments will explore algorithmic strategies such as selection, iteration, divide-and-conquer, and recursion, as well as introducing the Python programming language. Additional topics will include: the structure and organization of computers, the Internet and World Wide Web, abstraction as a means of managing complexity, social and ethical computing issues, and the question "What is computation?"

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Data Structures</strong><br />
In this course we will study the ideas and structures helpful in designing algorithms and writing programs for solving large, complex problems. The Java programming language and object-oriented paradigm are introduced in the context of important abstract data types (ADTs) such as stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. We will study efficient implementations of these ADTs, and learn classic algorithms to manipulate these structures for tasks such as sorting and searching. Prior programming experience is expected, but prior familiarity with the Java programming language is not assumed. (One CSCI course at the 0100-level) 3 hrs. lect./lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Theory of Computation</strong><br />
This course explores the nature of computation and what it means to compute. We study important models of computation (finite automata, push-down automata, and Turing machines) and investigate their fundamental computational power. We examine various problems and try to determine the computational power needed to solve them. Topics include deterministic versus non-deterministic computation, and a theoretical basis for the study of NP-completeness. (CSCI 0200 and CSCI 0201) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Advanced Beginning Dance I</strong> <br />
This is the first course in the studio sequence for students entering Middlebury with significant previous dance experience. It is also the course sequence for those continuing on from DANC 0160 or DANC 0161 and provides grounding in the craft of modern dance needed to proceed to more advanced levels. Modern dance movement techniques are strengthened to support an emerging individual vocabulary and facility with composition. Students regularly create and revise movement studies that focus on the basic elements of choreography and the relationship of music and dance. Readings, journals, and formal critiques of video and live performance contribute to the exploration of dance aesthetics and develop critical expertise. (DANC 0160 or by approval) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Regression Analysis</strong><br />
In this course regression analysis is introduced. The major focus is on quantifying relationships between economic variables. Multiple regression identifies the effect of several exogenous variables on an endogenous variable. After exploring the classical regression model, fundamental assumptions underlying this model will be relaxed, and further new techniques will be introduced. Methods for testing hypotheses about the regression coefficients are developed throughout the course. Both theoretical principles and practical applications will be emphasized. The course goal is for each student to employ regression analysis as a research tool and to justify and defend the techniques used.

In this course we will provide students with the tools to conceptualize, design, and carry out a research project in economics. Topics will include survey design, sampling and power, experimental design (in and out of the lab), natural experiments, and other approaches to identifying causal relationships. Drawing from several sub-disciplines in economics, students will examine, replicate, and critique various studies. Emphasis will be placed on the formulation of valid, feasible research questions, and on the description and interpretation of results. (ECON 0211) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Economics of Agricultural Transition</strong><br />
In 1860 farmers made up over half the population of this country and fed about 30 million people.  Today they number 2% of the population and produce more than enough to feed 300 million people.  In this course we will look at the history, causes, and results of this incredible transformation.  While studying the economic forces behind the changing farming structure, we will examine farm production, resources, technology, and agricultural policy.  Field trips to local farms and screenings of farm-related videos and movies will incorporate the viewpoint of those engaged in agriculture.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Economics: A Policy Approach</strong><br />
This course provides an overview of international trade and finance. We will discuss why countries trade, the concepts of absolute and comparative advantage, and gains from trade. We will explore commercial policies, arguments for and against tariffs, non-tariff barriers, dumping and subsidies, the role of the WTO, as well as the pros and cons of regional free trade associations. In the second part of the course we will primarily concentrate on international macroeconomics, focusing on foreign exchange rates, balance of payments, origins of and solutions to financial crises and the history and architecture of the international monetary system. Beginning Fall 2014, ECON 0240 no longer counts towards the ECON major or minor requirements. (Formerly ECON 0340) (ECON 0150 and ECON 0155) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Microeconomic Theory</strong><br />
Microeconomic theory concentrates on the study of the determination of relative prices and their importance in shaping the allocation of resources and the distribution of income in an economy. We will study the optimizing behavior of households in a variety of settings: buying goods and services, saving, and labor supply decisions. We will also examine the behavior of firms in different market structures. Together, the theories of household and firm behavior help illumine contemporary economic issues (discrimination in labor markets, mergers in the corporate world, positive and negative externalities, for example).

This course is dedicated to the proposition that economic reasoning is critical for analyzing the persistence of environmental damage and for designing cost-effective environmental policies. The objectives of the course are that each student (a) understands the economic approach to the environment; (b) can use microeconomics to illustrate the theory of environmental policy; and (c) comprehends and can critically evaluate: alternative environmental standards, benefits and costs of environmental protection, and incentive-based environmental policies.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Urban Economics</strong><br />
If economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources, then urban economics is the study of one scarce resource in particular: space.  This course will introduce students to new ways of thinking about the causes and consequences of the locational decisions made by firms and households.  We will explore how and why cities form, grow and decline, and how they occupy horizontal and vertical spaces.  Along the way we will use the tools of economics to discuss a variety of urban issues such as sprawl, transportation, big box stores and malls, the housing bubble, racial segregation, and neighborhood effects.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Game Theory I</strong><br />
Game theory is general in scope and has been used to provide theoretical foundations for phenomena in most of the social and behavioral sciences. Economic examples include market organization, bargaining, and the provision of public goods. Examples from other behavioral sciences include social dilemmas and population dynamics. In this course students learn the basics of what constitutes a game and how games are solved. This course is meant to be a broad introduction; students with advanced training in economics (or math) are encouraged to enroll directly in ECON 0390. (Formerly ECON 0380) (ECON 0155 and MATH 0121 required; ECON 0255 recommended) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Macroeconomics of Economic Development</strong><br />
In this course we will examine macroeconomic aspects of economic development. We will explore theoretical models combining insights from growth theory, classical development theory, and structuralist macroeconomics. Topics include dualism, surplus labor, increasing returns, poverty traps, and the role of external and demand constraints in the growth process. We will also review applied work and case studies, in order to understand how these theories illuminate concrete issues that have faced developing countries (ECON 0240 or ECON 0250) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Economic Prosperity in the Global Economy</strong><br />
The forces of globalization have powerful and controversial effects today, but this phenomenon has deep historical roots.  At the center of the globalization debate is whether prosperity is delivered to developing countries. In this course we will study the transformation to the global economy by exploring commodity, labor, and capital markets from a historical perspective. We will analyze the links among the economic dimensions of globalization, development, and growth. Our objective will be to examine the characteristics and evolution of globalization and its impact on overall growth, education, health, inequality, and poverty.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar on Economic Development</strong><br />
Much of the world still faces the daily pain of poverty. Developing countries have to accelerate their growth rates, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, address environmental concerns, and create productive employment. We examine the major analytic and policy issues raised by these challenges and study the need for a productive balance between market forces and positive state action. With the help of case studies from Asia, Latin America, and Africa, we focus on different development strategies adopted, the choice of policy instruments, and methods of implementation.

This course will show how economic analysis can be used to assess the impact of rapid population growth on economic development, the environment, and economic inequality. It will analyze the rapid "graying" of the industrialized countries and their struggle to cope with international migration. It will assess the causes of urban decay in the North and the explosive growth of cities in the South. The course will consider household-level decision-making processes; the effects of changing family structures; and the need to improve the status of women.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Public Economics</strong><br />
In this course we will examine the role of government in modern market economies. In particular we will explore the design and impact of government expenditure programs and taxation systems on the welfare and behavior of its citizens. We will consider the following questions: When is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is the most effective form of intervention? What effects do government policies have on incentives for firms, individuals, and others in the private sector? The course will cover a wide range of issues in public economics with a primary focus on current policy debates in the United States, employing standard empirical and theoretical tools used in public economic research. Attention will be given to classic works in public economics and recent work at the intersection of behavioral/experimental economics and public economics. (ECON 0255) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Senior Research Workshop I</strong><br />
In this first semester, students will design and begin their projects. Emphasis will be on designing a novel research question (while making the case for its importance) and an appropriate strategy for answering it. This requires immersion in the academic literature on the topic. General research principles and tools will be taught in class, as a group, while those specific to individual projects will be covered in one-on-one meetings. By the end of the term, students will outline their plan for completing the project, including demonstrating that it is a feasible research question for which the necessary information (e.g., data or source materials) is available or can be generated by the student (e.g., lab or other experiment). (Approval required)]]></description>

What mathematical knowledge should elementary and secondary teachers have in the 21st century? Participants in this course will strengthen and deepen their own mathematical understanding in a student-centered workshop setting. We will investigate the number system, operations, algebraic thinking, measurement, data, and functions, and consider the attributes of quantitative literacy. We will also study recent research that describes specialized mathematical content knowledge for teaching. (Not open to students who have taken MATH/EDST 1005. Students looking for a course in elementary school teaching methods should consider EDST 0315 instead.)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sophomore Seminar in the Liberal Arts</strong><br />
This course is designed for sophomores who are interested in exploring the meaning and the purpose of a liberal arts education. To frame this investigation, we will use the question "What is the good life and how shall I live it?" Through an interdisciplinary and multicultural array of readings and films we will engage our course question through intellectual discussion, written reflection, and personal practice. There will be significant opportunities for public speaking and oral presentation, as well as regular writing assignments, including a formal poster presentation.  Readings will include reflections on a liberal arts education in the U.S. (Emerson, Brann, Nussbaum, Oakeshott, Ladsen-Billings, bell hooks); on "the good life" (excerpts from Aristotle, sacred texts of different traditions); on social science analyses of contemporary life; texts on the neuroscience of happiness; as well as literary and cinematic representations of lives well-lived.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Reading & Writing the World: Teaching Literacy and Social Studies in the Elementary School</strong><br />
In this course, we examine what it means to be literate in the 21st century and ways in which all students can be empowered by the texts and teaching they encounter in schools. Students will develop their ability to enact literacy instruction based on current research about how children learn to read and write. We will take a critical look at texts—fiction, nonfiction, and historical—to consider the ways that texts read and write the world, develop abilities to select texts that empower all learners, and analyze retellings of historical events/persons to take into account multiple perspectives.  Many class sessions occur onsite at a local elementary school to provide consistent practice and supportive feedback on authentic components of teaching (transportation provided). In addition to class sessions, students will complete field experiences in a K-6 classroom in the Middlebury area to see the workings of an entire class. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Literacy Across the Secondary Curriculum</strong><br />
This course will acquaint prospective teachers with pedagogies that use literacy to help students learn subject matter, strategies, and skills in various secondary content areas. We will consider both the theory and practice of literacy through analysis of the nature of reading, writing, discussion, interpretation, and critical processes and practices. We will also consider the politics of literacy and the importance of socio-economic, linguistic, and cultural factors in making appropriate choices about methods and materials for diverse populations. Students will spend at least two hours per week observing and tutoring in secondary schools in the Middlebury area.  3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Reading Literature: Literature and the City</strong><br />
Today, more than half of the world's people live in cities and that proportion is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.  As centers of goods, information, capital, culture, and political power, cities have been crucial to our understanding of modernity.  The city is not only a built settlement in a specific place with particular forms of social interaction and power, it is equally to be understood as the symbolic life of that place. The city is constituted by and experienced as the images, sensations, emotions, and memories that it conveys.  We will focus on representations of the city and city life in selected poems, short stories, plays and novels. For some of the literary and cultural contexts in which to interpret representations of urban experience, we will read essays on the city.  We will also examine short pieces on theoretical approaches to the interpretation of literature, and brief accounts of literary terms and of elements of poetry, narrative fiction, and drama. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Reading Literature: Fantastic Voyages</strong><br />
If every work of literature takes us to some “far country” of a world partly real and partly imagined, this course will be a “grand tour” of far-flung destinations, some of which will possess a gentle beauty, some of which will prove dangerous and harrowing.  Our main concern, apart from learning how to appreciate a wide variety of styles, techniques, and genres, will be to acquire the analytical and writing skills that will allow students to convincingly communicate their feelings and insights about literature to others.  To accomplish this, we will closely read selected works from Shakespeare to the present, become familiar with a lexicon of helpful literary terms, and introduce ourselves to some basics of literary theory.  3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

This course seeks to develop skills for the close reading of literature through discussion of and writing about selected poems, plays, and short stories. A basic vocabulary of literary terms and an introductory palette of critical methods will also be covered, and the course's ultimate goal will be to enable students to attain the literary-critical sensibility vital to further course work in the major. At the instructor's discretion, the texts employed in this class may share a particular thematic concern or historical kinship. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Short Story (AL)</strong><br />
This course approaches the short story as a distinct prose genre, beginning with work by Edgar Allen Poe and Guy de Maupassant and concluding with stories by contemporary authors. We will examine the particularly notable growth of the genre in America and survey various trends in the form, from "local color" sketches and realistic tales to experiments in modernism and postmodernism. Throughout, we will consider issues of structure, characterization, style, and voice. Other authors may include Anderson, Barthelme, Cheever, Chekhov, Hemingway, Joyce, Moore, O'Connor, Twain, and Welty. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Dramatizing the Black Experience for the American Stage</strong><br />
In this course we will explore how influential contemporary African American dramatists bring to the American stage different aspects of the black experience.  From William Branch’s A Medal For Willie (1951) to Dominique Morisseau’s Detroit ’67 (2013), readings will provide students the opportunity to investigate how plays are interpreted by actors and directors, and wrestle with topics such as voting rights, cultural appropriation, housing discrimination, gender inequality, and equal access to education.  Beyond dramatic texts and critical readings, students will hear some of the playwrights (via video conferencing) offer their views on topics and issues we will discuss in class. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>British Literature and Culture: The Poetics of Entertainment</strong><br />
"Entertain" now means "amuse" or "divert," but long ago it could mean, more seriously, "hold together" in community. We will explore poetic "entertainment" as it evolved in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.  Recurring themes will include hospitality, gift-exchange, love, marriage, festival, politics, and friendship, all involving gender, class, and nationality. Our topic will also entail exploring what has made works canonical and the contribution of the canon to our own sense of community. Texts may include Beowulf, Gawain and the Green Knight, mystery and morality plays, and works by Marie de France, Chretien, Chaucer, Wyatt, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Contemporary Literary Theory</strong><br />
This course will introduce several major schools of contemporary literary theory. By reading theoretical texts in close conjunction with works of literature, we will illuminate the ways in which these theoretical stances can produce various interpretations of a given poem, novel, or play. The approaches covered will include New Criticism, Psychoanalysis, Marxism and Cultural Criticism, Feminism, and Post-Structuralism. These theories will be applied to works by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, The Brontës, Conrad, Joyce, and others. The goal will be to make students critically aware of the fundamental literary, cultural, political, and moral assumptions underlying every act of interpretation they perform.  3 hrs. lect/disc.]]></description>

A study of literary and other cultural forms in early America, including gravestones, architecture, furniture and visual art.  We will consider how writing and these other forms gave life to ideas about religion, diversity, civic obligation and individual rights that dominated not only colonial life but that continue to influence notions of "Americanness" into the present day. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Human Rights and World Literature</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the idiom of human rights in law, literature, and political culture. We will place literary representations of human rights violations (genocide, torture, detention and forced labor, environmental devastation, police violence) in dialogue with official human rights treaties and declarations in order to historicize and critique the assumptions of human rights discourse. Who qualifies as a “human” deserving of humanitarian intervention? How do human rights rehearse a colonial dynamic based on racial and geo-political privilege? To answer these questions we will turn to some of the most controversial voices in global fiction and poetry. 3 hrs. lect. <em>(Diversity)/</em>]]></description>

This course will explore the development of the novel in this century, with a primary focus on writers of the modernist period and later attention to more contemporary works.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Black Archives</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the archives of black thinkers such as Ralph Ellison, Robert Lynch, Claude McKay, Toni Morrison, Kara Walker, and Richard Wright. We will read rejected and lost manuscripts, unpublished drafts and notes, photographs, and complete diaries and novels that have never been read by the public but instead relegated to the archive. By recovering these lost texts, we will engage in activism by unsilencing these silenced black texts. To accomplish this task, students will manage a hardcopy archive and curate a digital archive. Topics will include diaspora and representation, personal and collective memory, gender and disability studies, and theories of the archive. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

Centered on a range of provocative works conceived at different historical moments and in different cultural situations, this course will explore some of the persistent imaginative preoccupations and far-reaching literary ambitions that serve to link authors working in a wide variety of genres and traditions. Authors to be considered this semester will include Jonathan Swift, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Petronius, Thomas Carlyle,  Herman Melville, Ivan Turgenev, Ernest Hemingway, Gustave Flaubert, Gertrude Stein, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Saul Bellow.

The 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s saw an unparalleled achievement in dramatic literature as the works of Eugene O'Neill, Lillian Hellman, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge were produced. This course will seek to analyze their plays both as dramatic art and in some cases as responses to social and political context. We will study film versions of the plays, as well as additional films that respond to themes in the plays, films such as <em>High Noon</em> and <em>On the Waterfront</em>. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Shakespeare’s Career (I) (Pre-1800)</strong><br />
In this course we will study the whole arc of William Shakespeare's literary career from the earliest histories, comedies, and non-dramatic poetry to the more mature tragedies and romances, with an eye to understanding Shakespeare’s development as a writer in his own time. How might the plays have resonated for his first audiences on stage, and how have subsequent readers drawn their own meanings from the published texts? Reading one play a week, we will pay close attention to such dramaturgical issues as Shakespeare’s construction of character and of plot, his adaptation of sources, and his modes of versification, as well as the ethical, political, and commercial implications of Shakespeare’s works during his lifetime, some of which stand in contrast with what we learn from them today. 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc./3 hrs. screen.]]></description>

In this course we will study both black and white writers' psychological responses to, and their verbal onslaughts on, the "peculiar institution" of chattel slavery.  We will work chronologically and across genres to understand how and by whom the written word was deployed in pursuit of physical and mental freedom and racial and socioeconomic justice. As the course progresses, we will deepen our study of historical context drawing on the substantial resources of Middlebury's special collections, students will have the opportunity to engage in archival work if they wish.  Authors will include Emerson, Douglass, Jacobs, Thoreau, Stowe, Walker, and Garrison. 3 hrs. sem. <em>(Diversity)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Novel and the City</strong><br />
In this course we will examine a number of novels from the 20th and 21st centuries that are about life in the city, taking a global and trans-national approach.  We will explore formations of urban life alongside transformations in the novel as a genre.  We will put these novels of city life in dialogue with critical theory—that is, theories of culture and society that have as their aim human emancipation (for example, Marxism, feminism, critical race studies, and postcolonial studies).  The novels we read will reflect important literary movements such as realism, modernism, and postmodernism.  (Not open to students who have taken ENAM 0447) <em>(Diversity)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar: Shaw, Stoppard and the Play of Ideas</strong><br />
In the 1890s Bernard Shaw introduced into British drama the play of ideas—a play which takes as its theme a social or philosophical problem—and combined it with the traditions of farce and high comedy to create an idiosyncratic kind of drama. For the pasts three decades Tom Stoppard has continued that tradition of wit and intellectual comedy. This seminar will study closely how these two playwrights have given vital form to the play of ideas in a dozen of their major plays. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

How are the preoccupations of mid 19th century American literature reflected in the 20th and 21st centuries?

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Conservation and Environmental Policy</strong><br />
This course examines conservation and environmental policy in the United States. In order to better understand the current nature of the conservation and environmental policy process, we will begin by tracing the development of past ideas, institutions, and policies related to this policy arena. We will then focus on contemporary conservation and environmental politics and policy making—gridlock in Congress, interest group pressure, the role of the courts and the president, and a move away from national policy making—toward the states, collaboration, and civil society. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Nature's Meanings: American Experiences</strong><br />
What we think of as "nature" today is the result of a complex and fascinating history. The many meanings of nature emerge from Americans' experiences of the physical world and their understandings of, and contests over, their place in that world. This course will investigate how American meanings of nature have changed from European-Native contact to the present. How have changing meanings reshaped American culture and the natural environment? These questions will be addressed from historical, literary, religious, and philosophical perspectives. Readings may include: Emerson, Thoreau, Marsh, Muir, Leopold, and Carson, as well as other Euro-American and Native American writers. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Human-Environment Relations: Middle East</strong><br />
In this course we will begin with an environmental history of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, asking such questions as: How does politics affect conservation practice? To what extent are formulations of nature constructed socially and politically? Whose rights are affected by protected areas and who decides governance criteria? The objectives of this course include providing students with an understanding of human-environment relations theory by addressing the regional specifics of modern environmental and social histories of these countries. We will look at animals, water, and forests in the literature of NGOs, UNEP reports, media, policy papers, and the academic literature. (One of the following: ENVS 0112, GEOG 0100, IGST 0101, SOAN 0103; Or by approval) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

In this course we will begin by studying theories of social and political change, and then we will analyze the systematic causes of poverty and environmental degradation around the world. We will then study prospective solutions, focusing on the role of selective members of global civil society in achieving these solutions. Over the course of the semester, each student will prepare a comprehensive analysis on how to tackle and overcome a specific global challenge. (ENVS 0211 or PSCI 0214) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sight and Sound I</strong><br />
In this course students will gain a theoretical understanding of the ways moving images and sounds communicate, as well as practical experience creating time-based work. We will study examples of moving images as we use cameras, sound recorders, and non-linear editing software to produce our own series of short works. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the possibilities of the medium through experimentation, analysis, and detailed feedback while exploring different facets of cinematic communication. (FMMC 0101, or FMMC 0102, or approval of instructor) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Cinema: The Art of Ellipsis</strong><br />
In 1936, film critic Roger Leenhardt declared, “cinema is the art of ellipsis.”  But this claim seems to contradict our most basic understanding of film.  After all, movies are about what we see, not about what we don’t.  Or are they?  In fact, Leenhardt was suggesting that the richest tradition in cinema explores the dynamic between the seen and the unseen, the shown and the unshown.  In this course we will carefully study international films that effectively work this dynamic in terms of narrative, character, and most importantly, cinematic style.  Films studied will include: Jean Renoir’s <em>Rules of the Game</em> (France, 1939); Ritwik Ghatak’s <em>The Cloud-Capped Star</em> (India, 1960); Abbas Kiarostami’s <em>Like Someone in Love</em> (France/Iran/Japan, 2012); Otto Preminger’s <em>Anatomy of a Murder</em> (US, 1959). 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. screen]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Storytelling in Film & Media</strong><br />
All media feature their own particular techniques of storytelling. We will explore how narrative forms work differently between film, television, and digital media, such as videogames. Drawing on theories of narrative developed to understand the structures, techniques, creative practices, and cultural impacts of narrative for literature and film, we will consider how different media offer possibilities to creators and viewers to tap into the central human practice of storytelling. Students will read theoretical materials and view examples of film, serial television, and games, culminating in a final research project, to better our understanding of narrative as a cultural practice. (FMMC 0101 or FMMC 0104) 3 hrs. sem./3 hrs. screen.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Gender and Sexuality in Media</strong><br />
In this course, we will explore the intersecting roles played by gender and sexuality in our media, focusing specifically on film, television, and digital culture. We will examine the multiple ways in which popular media texts construct and communicate gender and sexuality, and we will analyze the role of gender and sexuality in the processes of spectatorship and meaning-making. We will study a wide range of theories of gender and sexuality in media including feminist film theory, queer media theory, and literature on gender and sexuality in video game history and culture. 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. screen.]]></description>

Ever since the invention of recording, sound has increasingly been incorporated into all forms of contemporary art. In this course we will investigate the aesthetic power of sound as an expressive medium, while reviewing the rich history of sound art and its influence in a wide range of audiovisual practices. Through creative projects, lectures, auditions, and readings, we will develop students’ sensibilities and imagination concerning the use of sound, while improving their critical thinking and listening skills. We will cover basic concepts of acoustics, sound technology, audiovisual analysis, and sound production for film/video. (FMMC 0105 or by approval) 3 hrs. lect., 3 hrs. lab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Methods of Film Criticism</strong> <br />
In this seminar we will study film criticism.  Questions include: How does criticism combine description, analysis, interpretation and evaluation? What are the values and techniques of various methods of film analysis, such as genre, authorship and neo-formalism?  What can techniques, such as plot segmentation, teach us about film narrative?  How can criticism take into account the response of the spectator?  Films considered will be those which raise particular challenges for the film critic. This is an intensive writing course.  Assignments will include readings, screenings, class presentations, short papers, and a 10-12 page research essay.  (FMMC 0101 or FMMC 0102 or instructor's approval) 3 hrs. lecture/3 hrs. screen.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Contemporary France</strong><br />
In this interdisciplinary course we will examine the evolving social and political landscape of France in the 21st century. How is French society reconciling contemporary challenges with deeply entrenched institutions and values?  How does everyday life reflect the evolution of long-term trends?  How are immigration, growing inequalities, and membership in the European Union challenging French identity and the notion of “Frenchness”?  We will focus our attention on demography and the family, the educational system, politics, and the French social model or welfare state. Emphasis will be on oral expression and the acquisition of specialized vocabulary.  Sources will include articles from the French and American press, documents, and film. This course is recommended for all students planning to study in France. (FREN 0210 or FREN 0221; open to first-semester first-year students with permission.)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Women in French Historical Films: Looking at the Past through a Modern Lens</strong><br />
In this course we will focus on the representation of powerful women in French historical films produced since the early 1990s. At a time when the notion of gender parity was becoming prevalent in French political life, one would expect contemporary filmmakers to adopt a positive perspective on women in power. Yet, by studying such films as <em>La Reine Margot</em>, <em>Ridicule</em>, <em>Indochine</em>, and <em>Lucie Aubrac</em> and comparing them to various written accounts and/or literary texts, we will see that this is rarely the case. Historical films often offer as much information about the period when they were produced as they do about the period they depict, if not more. Could representations of powerful women in modern heritage films point to a general cultural tendency in late 20th century France to depreciate the notion of emancipation as a reaction to the very emergence of women in the political sphere? (Two courses among FREN 0210, FREN 0221, FREN 0230, or by waiver). 3 hrs lect/disc +2 hrs. screenings.]]></description>

In this course we will focus on the foreign policy of Fifth Republic France (1958-Present).  In the first part, we will study the role of Charles de Gaulle in defining the place of France in the world after the liberation and in establishing the major tenets of French foreign policy.  In the second part, we will examine the evolution of French foreign policy by focusing on three main themes: (1) the relationship of France with its former colonies; (2) transatlantic relations; and (3) European integration.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>French Orientalism</strong><br />
In this course we will examine different ways in which writers have described cultural encounters between France and the Orient, specifically the Islamic cultures of North Africa and the Middle East.  These encounters have been the source of many enduring myths fabricated by the French about the Orient and in the process, about themselves. Starting with Montesquieu's <em>Lettres persanes</em>, we will discuss the role played by the Orient in his critique of socio-political practices in the Old Regime. We will then examine various strategies for apprehending and appropriating North African cultures in orientalist travel narratives, short stories, and paintings from the 19th century. Questions of representation, otherness, identity, and gender will inform our discussions. (FREN 0221 or by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Chance *<br />
A prominent statistician once wrote, “Statistics exists only at the interfaces of chance and empirical data. But it exists at every such interface.” Are most cancers attributable to bad luck, as Forbes recently suggested?  Do fluctuations in US News college rankings reflect educational quality? Is texting while driving riskier than drunk driving?  You can't follow the news, choose a college, or even get behind the wheel without encountering statistical claims.  Which should you trust?  Our readings will include your favorite newspaper, Stephen J. Gould's essays on excellence and variability, and Edward Tufte's critique of data graphics in the popular press.. 3 hrs. sem.</strong>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Shaping the Future</strong><br />
Molecular biotechnology has provided extraordinary benefits to humankind, including the ability to cure disease, remove pollutants from the environment, and create crops that are resistant to disease. From these and other advances emerge a variety of social concerns.  Should we use recombinant DNA technology to disclose our medical futures?  Should we release genetically engineered organisms into the environment?  Is it ethical to patent a living organism?  Is it acceptable to clone animals?  In this seminar we will explore these and other biotechnological advances and promote discussion and debate of the societal implications that derive from the genetic engineering revolution. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this seminar—designed for international as well as U.S. students—we will examine American culture, as perceived both in the U.S. and abroad, through the lenses of gender, sexuality, race, class, and migration.  Using literature and popular media, we will develop an understanding of the complexities and challenges in American culture, articulating them in inquiry-based writing and oral presentations, and learning how scholarly work has been integral to understanding them. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Shakespeare's Characters</strong><br />
Shakespeare’s reputation owes much to his characters. Yet memorable as these are, they abound in inconsistencies. What did they mean in Shakespeare’s time, and how do they still succeed? What explains the charisma of Bottom, the idiot who cannot act, or the appeal of Shylock, the vicious stereotype of Jewishness?  Othello’s jealousy renders him a murderer, yet he elicits empathy; Desdemona is first assertive, then submissive.  What do these contradictions mean?  What do they tell us about attitudes towards race, gender, psychology, and theater in Shakespeare’s time and today? Addressing such questions, we will develop critical thinking and writing skills. Texts will include <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, <em>Othello</em>, and contextual readings. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Psychology and the Meaning of Life</strong><br />
The goal of this seminar will be to explore what psychology can teach us about the meaning of life.  We will start with earlier, more philosophical models (Freud, Frankl, Maslow) and conclude with modern empirical approaches to the study of “happiness” and “meaningfulness” (Seligman, Czikszentmihalyi, Kasser).  This seminar will include a substantial service-learning component in which students will volunteer in community organizations and use those experiences as material for class discussion and assignments. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

A normally-developing child can acquire any human language in the right environment, yet it is much more difficult for adults to achieve native proficiency in a second language. Why? In this course we will explore questions such as: How does first language acquisition happen? Is it effortless? Are humans “hardwired” with language? Is it true that after the “Critical Period,” i.e., the onset of puberty, humans have lost this capacity? We will also explore social and cultural constraints on language acquisition, and learn basic techniques for collecting and analyzing data in language acquisition research. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Literature and Philosophy of Friendship</strong><br />
In this seminar we will explore major works of literature and philosophy from earlier centuries on the ideal of friendship. What are the traditional obligations of “true” friendship? Are they different from those of the Facebook age? Is friendship like love? Is true friendship between the sexes possible? Does racial difference affect friendship? Is homoeroticism or homophobia part of friendship? Readings include Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, Cicero, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Bacon, Kant, Emerson, and Thoreau as well as selected texts in non-European traditions. Special emphasis will be placed on grammar, rhetorical style, public speaking, and multimedia presentation.  3 hrs. sem. E]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Breaking the Code: The Enigma of Alan Turing</strong><br />
British mathematician Alan Turing broke the Nazis' prized Enigma cipher in World War II, created the foundations of computer science, and pioneered the fields of artificial intelligence (“Can Machines Think?”) and neural networks. Turing was arrested for homosexuality and forced to undergo hormone treatments. He died by cyanide poisoning at a relatively young age. His brilliant achievements and tragic death have been the subject of biographies, essays, plays, novels, and films, most recently the Academy Award winning The Imitation Game.  We will explore the life and works of this remarkable individual in the context of the war and its aftermath. 3 hrs. sem./screening]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Visions of Mortality</strong><br />
In this seminar we will examine the nature, meaning, and implications of our mortality. We will begin by examining historical and contemporary philosophical views on death and by considering questions such as: Can an understanding of death tell us anything about what makes life good? How should the fact of our mortality influence the lives we lead? We will then address contemporary biomedical issues regarding death, considering questions such as: How does technology influence our conception of death? What attitude ought we to embrace regarding increasing advances in life-extending medical treatments? Readings will likely include works by Tolstoy, Lucretius, Nagel, Camus, and Callahan. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this course we will explore the writings of C.S.Lewis, with an eye to how important philosophical and theological ideas evident in his non-fiction essays and books find expression in his major works of fantastic fiction: <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and the <em>Ransom Trilogy</em>. Particular emphasis will be given to the implications of his views of nature and ecology (including ecological practices). We will focus on Lewis’s own writing, especially his fantasy novels, but will also read a small selection of writing about Lewis, such as Alan Jacobs’ <em>The Narnian</em>. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

What are human rights?  What duties, if any, flow from them, and who is morally obligated to bear those duties?  In this course, we will investigate the philosophical origins and development of the concept of human rights.  We will critically analyze both historical and contemporary moral perspectives on the existence and nature of human rights.  What does it mean to say that one possesses a human right?  In addition to examining the existence and nature of human rights, we will take a closer look at the issue of human rights related to world poverty and humanitarian intervention. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Art and Nature of Contemplation</strong><br />
What would it be like to attend to oneself, to others, and to the world with the concentration and insight of a Zen-inspired poet? How does a forest, a river, a neighborhood, or a city feel to an artist in open attentiveness to the immediate environment? This semnar invites students to experience contemplative knowing of self and surroundings through mindfulness meditation and through daily reflections in words, sketches or photographs. We will learn about the traditional origins of meditation and more recent uses of mindfulness for personal wellbeing. To give context to our own practice we will engage critically with essays, poems, art installations, and films that have arisen from contemplations of nature in ancient and modern times. Our study begins with Japanese poets Saigyo and Basho, the classic filmmaker Ozu, and the anime director Miyazaki. We then explore and compare meditative works by American and international writers and artists Annie Dillard, Andy Goldsworthy, and Maya Lin. We will conclude with the question of the relationship between mindfulness and social awareness in the works of Shigeru Ban. 3 hrs. sem/disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Quiet American’s Book of Laughter and Forgetting the Thing around your Neck: The Personal and the Political</strong><br />
If one of the ideas behind the famous 1960s statement “the personal is political” is to suggest that how we conduct ourselves in our private lives can affect structures of power in society at large, the reverse is also true. The political/social/cultural systems in which we live affect, if not determine, the kinds of relationships we have with other people. In this seminar we will explore some of these reciprocities in works of fiction and memoir by Milan Kundera, Chimamanda Adichie, Alexander Maksik, Philip Klay, and others, with occasional complementary readings in political theory and other types of analysis.  Emphasis is on collaborative inquiry and various modes of response to the material. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Mystics, Saints, and Shamans</strong><br />
What is the nature of a mystical experience? Are “mysticism” or “sainthood” phenomena with a universal core found equally across cultures? What is the role of cultural and social contexts in the formation of such experiences and phenomena? How exactly do we define who is a saint or a shaman? This course will be a comparative study of extraordinary experiences and manipulations of reality claimed by charismatic religious figures across time and space. We will discuss a wide variety of examples from traditionally renowned saints of the medieval Islamic world to  contemporary New Age leaders in America. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

How does language shape our experience of the world?  What does pronunciation reveal about cultural identity? What can we learn about language from the way small children speak? How do communicative strategies vary across languages? Why do languages change over time?  Through the lens of linguistics, we will explore the structure and usage of language in daily life. We will discuss speech and text samples from conversations, novels, advertisements, anime, children’s shows, and more. Languages discussed will include English and Japanese, but no background in any foreign language is necessary, as translations and transliterations will be provided. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

Since his rediscovery in the 19th century, Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer has received sustained and enthusiastic praise for his refined paintings of everyday life in 17th-century Holland.  In this course we will examine how Vermeer’s art and life have been evaluated from the 17th to the 21st century.  We will not only contextualize Vermeer in his own time and place, but we will also consider how his work has elicited a range of responses in modern times, including forgeries, novels, and films. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Language and Ethnic Identity</strong><br />
Language is a central feature of human identity. In this seminar we will explore the multiple ways in which language is used in society to express, create, and perform these identities. We will analyze—from a sociolinguistic perspective—how variation in speakers’ linguistic resources (e.g., pronunciation, syntax, word choice, language choice) can serve as tools to shape, stereotype, or subvert national, regional, and other types of ethnic identities. We will draw examples from linguistic research, literature, film, television, political discourse, popular songs, the internet, and other media in the United States as well as in other societies. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Mahatma Gandhi: Myth and Reality</strong><br />
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948), known as the Mahatma or Great Soul, was both revered and despised. Lauded as the ‘Father’ of independent India, he was nevertheless blamed for its partition. Seen as the champion of Untouchables, he was distrusted by those he called the children of god. Characterizing himself as a Hindu reformer and an Indian nationalist, he was ultimately assassinated by a Hindu nationalist. Who was Gandhi and why was he opposed? In this seminar we will read primary and secondary sources to examine Gandhi’s ideas and actions, paying particular attention to the contradictions in his life. 3 hrs. sem. )]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The “good” Body</strong><br />
In this seminar we will examine the roles bodies play in defining our public and private identities.  What indications of beliefs, access, and cultural values do our bodies provide? What counts as a “good” body? Who has one (or doesn’t), and why? The many different answers to these and related questions impact every body in our Middlebury community and beyond. Topics will include aesthetic and ideological issues relating to the body; course work includes physically based workshops, oral presentations, written analyses and creative responses. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Fifty Shades of Italy: an Exploration of Contemporary Italian History, Culture and Society</strong><br />
Italy is the land of a seductive culture that for centuries has inspired undeniable romanticism and continues to capture the imagination of many. But there is more to Italy than beautiful landscapes and world famous cuisine. From the darkness of fascism and terrorism, to the sophisticated colors of Italian fashion and design, to the dramatic tones of illegal immigration, we will explore, discover, or critically revisit the many shades that together compose the complexity of the Italian mosaic.  Our interdisciplinary approach will include short stories, essays, newspaper articles, films, music, and images. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Plagues, Past and Present</strong><br />
In this seminar we will consider how infectious diseases emerge, why they persist, how they can be eradicated, and why some diseases believed to be “under control” have returned. We will study pathogens and human biology with particular attention to how biological, behavioral, and social factors converge to support endemic and epidemic disease in people.  Readings will include books, articles written for the layperson, and primary scientific literature that examine epidemic disease from the Middle Ages to the present, with predictions for the future. We will pay particular attention to the evolution of pathogens and new diseases within populations. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this seminar we will study, analyze, and write immigrant stories and histories from Latin America and the colonial and post-colonial Caribbean.  How do we write the history of a family member, living or deceased?  How is history different from biography? We will analyze diverse written, oral, and visual texts about transnational experiences including works by Julia Alvarez, Derek Walcott, Tânia Cypriano, Edwidge Danticat, Richard Rodriguez, Ruben Blades, and others. Ultimately, with the aid of primary sources, oral history, genealogy, law enforcement records, as well as other, less conventional resources, we will reconstruct and write the transnational lives of immigrants in our families and communities. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this seminar we will begin with the question: how can art, specifically theatrical art, impact the world around us? We will explore a variety of contemporary works for the theatre that examine the possibilities of change (political, cultural, environmental). The seminar will also contain experiential components—students will be required to devise and perform various scenarios designed to impact a specifically targeted issue, and lead a discussion subsequent to each presentation. Authors to be read include American writers Anna Deveare Smith, Eve Ensler, and the Tectonic Project and British writers Caryl Churchill, David Hare, Robin Soans, Lucy Kirkwood, and others. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Acoustic Ecology</strong><br />
Acoustic ecology is the study of sounds in relationship to life and society. An interdisciplinary field, it explores the social, cultural, scientific, and ecological aspects of the sonic environment.  In this seminar  we will gain auditory literacy by experiencing the world through sound (e.g., noise, speech, music). Topics will include the impact of noise on society; the urban experience through sound (especially Berlin and New York); aural architecture; production and reception of speech; representations of sound in literature and the visual arts; and even emotional responses to certain songs. Sources include texts by neuroscientists, literary scholars, linguists, anthropologists, musicologists, and others; music, and films. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Mastodons, Mermaids, and Dioramas: Capturing Nature in the Americas</strong><br />
Why did 18th-century museums stuff and mount exotic and domestic animals? Why does the American Museum of Natural History still house dioramas of so-called "native peoples" hunting?  How has the study and staging of nature transferred into various kinds of artistic expression?  In this seminar we will examine the intertwining of art, science, and ecology in the United States from the 1700s to the present day. Objects of study will include museum dioramas, scientific models, artifacts, and artworks collected during scientific expeditions, as well as the work of Walton Ford and Christy Rupp, contemporary artists whose works engage ecological issues. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Music, Race, and Place</strong><br />
In this seminar we will consider how the rise of urban African America shaped and was shaped by the evolution of contemporary black music.  We will examine blues, soul, and early hip hop music in their historical and spatial contexts, beginning with the Great Migration, progressing through the heyday of centers of black life like New York’s Harlem and Chicago’s Bronzeville, and ending with the development and decline of high-rise housing projects.  Driven by the recurrent questions of “why here?” and “why now?” we will work to understand what the growth of these various musical forms meant to urban African America. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this seminar students will experience a hands-on introduction to electronic music, designed for those with little or no experience in the medium. No musical or technical background is required. Rather than presenting electronic music as a technological matter, this course will allow students to use creative projects to explore and express their own passions about their lives and the world around them. Written and spoken projects will explore the history of the medium and artists who have created significant work. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

Technology and new media, such as smart phones and social media, are changing how we think, relate, connect, and learn. We will read cultural accounts of the recent changes in our society as well as examine what recent psychological literature tells us about the pros and cons of our wired world. We will review related research on such topics as attention, relationships, video games, the psychological effects of social media, brain and mind, learning and education, and relationships.  The seminar will involve critical analysis and understanding of research in a new field, examined in the contexts of our own lives and experiences. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

From Standard Oil’s marketing of kerosene in 1890s China to 21st century conflicts over undersea reserves in the western Pacific, oil has played a key role in Asia’s modern development. In this seminar we will examine the expansion of European, American, and Japanese petroleum companies in East and Southeast Asia, the role of oil in the Pacific War, and China’s present-day efforts to fuel its growing economy. By analyzing novels, films, advertisements, and historical scholarship, we will learn about modern changes to local patterns of resource extraction as well as the emergence of new understandings of nature, illumination, and production. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

On April 18, 1906, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked San Francisco. Although the trembling lasted only about 60 seconds, its aftershocks – including a devastating fire that leveled much of the city – were felt for significantly longer. Using scholarly readings as well as a mix of primary sources such as photographs, maps, letters, and memoirs, students in this seminar will examine the 1906 earthquake and fire from an historical perspective. We will use this episode of urban disaster and reconstruction as a lens to understand the built and natural environment, Progressive politics, and race relations in America at the beginning of the 20th century. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Karma</strong><br />
Why do things happen to us as they do? For many throughout Asia, the answer is or has been karma, the ancient Indian notion that over multiple lifetimes individuals reap the effects of past actions. We will examine this powerful idea of moral causality in depth, considering strikingly varied versions in classical Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, and the wealth of practices believed to improve future lives (and ultimately lead to liberation). We will also investigate the diverse and surprising consequences of karma in some Asian societies—including the justification of social hierarchy, the mistreatment of some groups, and the emergence of vegetarianism—as well as the role of karma in literature and film, especially in East Asia. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Teachers and Students, Ancient to Modern</strong><br />
Hillel used to say, “The shy one cannot learn, and the impatient one cannot teach.” Confucius said: “If I lift up one corner and the student can't come back with the other three, I won't do it again."  Cultures ancient and modern have reflected on the responsibilities of teachers and students, grappling with what constitutes an effective teacher or a successful student.  What are the virtues—and perils—of discipleship?  Of charisma? Should a teacher be gentle or forceful? Strict or lenient? Are teachers creators or conduits of tradition?  In this seminar we will explore these questions in a range of historical periods and places, using film, literature, religious, and philosophical texts.  Texts will include the Bible, Analects, and writings by Plato, Rousseau, and Helen Keller; films will include <em>Dead Poet’s Society</em>. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Reading Jared Diamond</strong><br />
Jared Diamond is a best-selling author on topics of world prehistory and environmental conservation.  In this seminar we will read and discuss Diamond’s work alongside that of his critics.  By taking parallel case studies from New Guinea, Mesoamerica, and Greenland (for example), students will learn critical thinking and analysis skills while also undertaking a survey of world cultures. The core questions facing the class are “why has the world turned out this way, and not some other?” and “what are the causes and consequences of environmental degradation?” 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sherlock Holmes Across Media</strong><br />
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first created Sherlock Holmes in 1886. Since then, the consulting detective has continued to solve mysteries in literature, radio, film, television, and digital media. Indeed, Sherlock Holmes inspired what many think of as the earliest media fandom. Why has Sherlock Holmes continued to be such a fascinating figure for almost a century and a half? How have Holmes and his sidekick Watson (or Sherlock and John) transformed in their different iterations across media, culture, and history? And what does it mean for contemporary television series <em>Elementary</em> and <em>Sherlock</em> to reimagine Sherlock Holmes for the digital age? 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Pyramid Schemes, Bubbles, and Crashes</strong><br />
In this seminar we will study the anthropology of exchange, then use it to analyze ethnographies of financial speculators, labor migrants, microcredit borrowers, and other agents and victims of global capitalism.  We will focus on conflicting obligations to kin and to creditors, on how people in different cultures and social classes juggle these obligations, and how the growth of financial debt can turn social relationships into commodities.  Studying debt and how it is leveraged in different societies and historical eras will show why capitalism is so vulnerable to speculative booms, swindles, and collapses. 3 hrs. sem. )]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>How Ideas Change the World</strong><br />
How can citizens put their ideas into action and achieve social change? For example, how did citizens in the United States prompt politicians to pass a health care law, or protestors in Tunisia force a transition to democracy? In this seminar we will study why policymakers respond to new policy ideas from citizens, intellectuals, and social movements.  To answer these questions, we will examine case studies from around the world—including Iran, China, and the United States—involving questions of environmental policy, enfranchisement, and social welfare. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Film Form, Film Meaning: Fellini and the Art of Cinema</strong><br />
In this seminar we will discover the hidden art of cinematic form.  How do movies construct meaning?  Why are they often so emotionally engaging?  How is cinema related to the other arts (literature, painting, photography, music)?  In the first half of the seminar we will analyze six films by Federico Fellini—one of Europe’s most famous auteur directors (La strada, La dolce vita, 8 1/2, among others).  In the second half of the seminar, students will analyze films of their choosing (any film by any European director).  Armed with the critical skills gained through analyzing Fellini, groups of students will then screen their films to the entire class, complete a major classroom presentation, and engage in original research. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Animal Encounters in Literature</strong><br />
Animals have haunted literary texts ever since Aesop’s fables.  What different roles do they play? In this seminar we will explore the complexity of representing animals in literature by studying novels and short stories that imagine wildlife, revisit the myth of animal metamporphosis, or use animals as symbols for other purposes.  We will discuss what specific social, political, and linguistic issues these literary texts address and in some cases, how they complicate our understanding of the human/animal divide. Texts include: Balzac, Passion in the Desert, Kafka, The Metamorphosis, and Darrieussecq’s dystopian novel Pig Tales. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

Students will explore the texture of the text, learn to identify an issue, research, then organize their findings in oral and written presentations of that work using 21st century means and technologies. Drawing from a palette of creative works such as <em>Pale Fire</em>, <em>S./, /Mission Impossible III</em>, <em>Star Trek IV</em>, <em>Sandrine’s Case</em>, <em>The Woman in White</em>, and TED talks, you will find patterns and meaning in a random, hyperlinked world of associations and interconnections, and then organize and articulate them to an audience. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Empire Writes Back: Politics and Literature from Postcolonial Africa, the Caribbean, and South Asia</strong><br />
A hundred years ago, Britain ruled about a quarter of the world’s population, and the British Empire covered approximately a quarter of the earth’s land surface.  Though most of the colonies have won formal independence, the effects of global imperialism continue to be felt, and arguably Empire has taken on other forms.  In this seminar we will discuss fiction, poetry, and drama by postcolonial writers such as J. M. Coetzee, Derek Walcott, Daljit Nagra, Wole Soyinka, Mahashweta Devi, Jean Rhys, Arundhati Roy, Edward Said, and Frantz Fanon, addressing questions about the nature and effects of colonization, anti-colonial resistance, representation, agency, and power. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Feasts and Festivals of the Ancient World</strong><br />
In this seminar we will examine Greek and Roman feasts and religious festivals through an exploration of mythology, ritual, and sacrifice. While ancient myths revealed tensions between the human world and the natural and divine orders, festivals commemorating the myths offered opportunities to enact and resolve these tensions ritually. As feasts figured prominently in festivals, we will also seek to understand how food and drink, and the contexts in which they were consumed, served as markers of ethnicity, social class, and gender. Lastly, we will investigate the meaning of prohibitions against certain foods, including beans, raw flesh, and human meat. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

This course is an introduction to how geographers view the world and contribute to our understanding of it. Where do the phenomena of human experience occur? Why are they there? What is the significance? These questions are fundamental for explaining the world at different scales from the global to the local. Throughout, we will focus on the spatial basis of society, its continual reorganization through time, and how various human and environmental problems can be usefully analyzed from a geographic perspective.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geographic Perspectives on International Development</strong><br />
This class is an exploration of some of the key concepts, theories, ideologies, and practices of international development as they relate to issues of environmental and social change. We will approach these “ways of knowing” about development and the environment through three   topics: (1) “natural” disasters; (2) oil; and (3) waste. For each of these topics we will draw on multiple case studies across the world including Haiti, New Orleans, Pakistan, India, Nigeria, and  South Africa. These case studies will help us to more fully discuss and understand the dynamics of who does development, how, where, why, and with what results. With each of the themes we will examine different practices of international development,  including  post-disaster international aid, the shipping and dumping of waste, and  environmental conflicts in the everyday lives of people in oil-rich areas of the world. This approach will allow us to break down mainstream discourses of development and “sustainability,” critically examine development practice, and imagine alternative approaches to development. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Urban Geography</strong><br />
Urban landscapes are the expression of economic, political, and socio-cultural processes layered on top of each other in particular time-space contexts. In this course, students will theoretically and empirically examine the complex and dynamic urban landscape. Students will gain a theoretical understanding of the location of cities within a larger global economic system of cities, along with the internal organization of economic, cultural, and social functions within cities. We will also examine the processes behind contemporary urban issues such as homelessness, boosterism, urban renewal, gentrification, poverty, and crime. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geopolitics of the Middle East</strong><br />
This course examines the Middle East from a geographical perspective with emphasis on the historical and political underpinnings of the region. The Middle East, the cradle of civilization, has been, due to its geography, one of the major arenas for political and ideological conflicts. It has been subject to an unequal power relationship with the West, which, together with Islam, has affected the level of its political, social, and economic development. This course will provide an analytical introduction to the historical, political, social, and economic geography of the region and will analyze the major transitions this region has undergone. 3 hrs.lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Health & Medical Geography</strong><br />
In this course we will explore three major geographic approaches to studying health, morbidity, health care, and human wellbeing using a variety of approaches: 1) ecological, in which the relationship between human and environment is analyzed; 2) social, including socio-behavioral and political economy approaches; and 3) spatial analytic, which draw on mapping, geospatial, and spatial statistical techniques to identify patterns. We will apply these approaches to case studies from North America, South East Asia, Sub-Saharan Afric,a and elsewhere. We will also consider spatial variation of pandemics and trans-world connections and processes relevant to global health. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geomorphologyic Process</strong><br />
In this course we will investigate processes that shape the Earth's surface, including weathering, mass movements, and the effects of water, wind, and ice. Students will examine how such processes govern the evolution of landforms in differing climatic, tectonic, and lithologic settings. Field and laboratory study will focus on the role of active surficial processes, as well as glaciation and other past events, in development of the landscape of west-central Vermont. We will also discuss implications for human activities and maintenance of natural systems. (GEOL 0112 or GEOL 0161 or GEOL 0170 or by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Practicing Human Geography</strong><br />
Asking and answering geographical questions often invokes a variety of specific spatial-analytical techniques and methodologies. In Practicing Human Geography, students will employ a variety of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in specific research contexts. Through lectures, examples, and readings, students will learn the types of questions each technique is designed to answer, how it works, and how to interpret the results. During weekly discussion sections, students will gain hands on experience with various software packages and employ these techniques to complete a series of research exercises. These research exercises, participation, and a final exam will form the basis for evaluation. (GEOG 0100, and at least one 0200 level course in geography) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar in Feminist Geography</strong><br />
Feminist geographers have made major contributions to the discipline of Geography over the past several decades. In this course we will focus on how feminist geography might help us to address critical questions about spatiality and power relations. We will read key writings on feminist thought and practice and consider how axes of difference from gender and race, to sexuality and class work to constitute particular spaces and places. Seminar readings will also engage different methodological approaches employed by feminist scholars. We will focus on feminist contributions to understandings of knowledge production, work and social reproduction, development, globalization, and political processes. (Senior majors only; others by waiver) 3 hr. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Elements of Oceanography</strong><br />
Oceanographic exploration is introduced through study of ocean basins and continental margins. The multidisciplinary nature of oceanography is emphasized by using principles of marine geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and biology to address contemporary problems. Techniques of data collection and analysis are taught aboard the College's research vessel, R/V Folger, located on Lake Champlain. 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab/field trips]]></description>

This course explores the fascinating geology of Vermont. Students learn the geology through six field problems, involving extended trips around western Vermont. Lectures on the meaning of rocks support the fieldwork. The last few indoor labs are devoted to understanding the geologic map of Vermont. Emphasis is on descriptive writing and on use of data to interpret origin of rocks. Culminates in a written report on the geologic and plate tectonic evolution of Vermont.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Geomorphology</strong> <br />
In this course we will investigate processes that shape the Earth's surface, including weathering, mass movements, and the effects of water, wind, and ice. Students will examine how such processes govern the evolution of landforms in differing climatic, tectonic, and lithologic settings. Field and laboratory study will focus on the role of active surficial processes, as well as glaciation and other past events, in development of the landscape of west-central Vermont. We will also discuss implications for human activities and maintenance of natural systems. (GEOL 0112 or GEOL 0161 or GEOL 0170 or by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

Field and laboratory study will focus on the role of active surficial processes, as well as glaciation and other past events, in development of the landscape of west-central Vermont. We will also discuss implications for human activities and maintenance of natural systems. (GEOL 0112 or GEOL 0161 or GEOL 0170 or by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. lab]]></description>

Geared toward quick and early proficiency in comprehension and free expression. Grammatical structures are practiced through group activities and situational exercises (e.g., role-playing games and partner interviews). Active class participation by students is required and will be counted toward the final grade. Since this is an integrated approach, there will be laboratory assignments but no special drill sections. Classes meet five times a week. Students take GRMN 0102 as their winter term course. 5 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this course students will encounter the Germany of today through an exploration of current newspaper and journal articles. The theories of Kramsch, Foucault, Byrum, and others allow for intercultural analyses and enable students to critically assess assumptions, definitions, and expressions of their own cultures vis-á-vis German culture. In addition to completing short writing assignments and presentations, students work in pairs in order to develop projects that focus on specific issues in current German cultural debates. 3 hrs. sem.</strong>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>How Grim Are the Grimm Brothers? Rereading Fairy Tales</strong><br />
This course focuses on modern (re)readings of the Grimm brothers' fairy tales. Starting with a discussion of the brothers' lives and the cultural setting at the beginning of the nineteenth century, we concentrate on contemporary issues in these tales. Various approaches to literature allow us to create many spheres of interpretation. Historical, textual, psychological, and philosophical readings generate an array of possible meanings for modern audiences. (Formerly GRMN 0313) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Sociology of Gender</strong><br />
What is gender and what would a sociology of it look like? When did gender become a category of inquiry and more importantly why? We will look at how the meaning and performance of gender changed over time, from Classical Greece to Victorian England, to the contemporary U.S. We will also look at how gender changes depending on one’s position in social space, e.g. one’s race, class, sexuality, and nationality. Finally, we will consider how the need to look at gender is the result of a variety of discourses, from psychoanalysis to capitalism to movements of liberation such as feminism. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Foundations in Women's and Gender Studies</strong><br />
This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of gender, sexuality, and feminist studies. Examining gender and sexuality always in conjunction with the categories of race and class, the course foregrounds how inequalities are perpetuated in different fields of human activity and the creative ways in which groups have resisted these processes. The course is organized in sections to illuminate the effects of particular social institutions and structures on individual lives. Each section will introduce a broad overview of feminist interventions in different fields of inquiry. Cumulatively, the course reveals the importance of gender and sexuality as analytical categories to understand social reality and to comprehend important areas of culture. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Philosophy and Feminism</strong><br />
This course will examine the contributions of various feminists and feminist philosophers to some of the central problems of philosophical methodology, epistemology, philosophy of science, metaphysics, and ethics. Are there gendered assumptions in operation in the way particular philosophical problems are framed? For example, do the politics of gender contribute to accounts of objective knowledge and rationality? Are some philosophical perspectives better suited to the goals of feminism than others? We will also examine the general relationship between feminism and philosophy, and we will reflect on the relevance of theorizing and philosophizing for feminist political practice.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sexuality in the United States: Histories and Identities</strong><br />
What does sexuality mean? In the United States the meanings of sexuality are highly contested, historically and in the present. Working from an interdisciplinary perspective, we will look at different historical and theoretical approaches to thinking about issues of sexuality and to writing its histories. Drawing from feminist scholarship, queer theory, and lesbian, gay, and transgender studies, we will discuss sexual identities, representations of sexuality, and sexual cultures, and examine how intersecting categories such as race, class, disability, and gender influence how sexuality is understood. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Gender in Japan (in English)</strong><br />
In this course we will examine changing ideas about gender and sexuality in Japan in the 10th through 20th centuries, with special attention to the modern period. Sources will include literary texts, films, and social/historical studies. We will discuss topics, including women's writing in classical Japan; the commercialization of sexuality in the 18th century; ideas of "homosexuality" in late-medieval and modern times; and women's social roles and political struggles in the 20th century. 3 hr. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Gender and Sexuality in Media</strong><br />
In this course, we will explore the intersecting roles played by gender and sexuality in our media, focusing specifically on film, television, and digital culture. We will examine the multiple ways in which popular media texts construct and communicate gender and sexuality, and we will analyze the role of gender and sexuality in the processes of spectatorship and meaning-making. We will study a wide range of theories of gender and sexuality in media including feminist film theory, queer media theory, and literature on gender and sexuality in video game history and culture. 3 hrs. lect./3 hrs. screen.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>From Deviance to Discipline: A Cultural History of the Body in Late 19th and Early 20th Century Western Europe</strong><br />
In this course students will explore varying modes of constructing the body—the diseased body, the criminal body, the racialized body, the machine body, and more—in late 19th  and early 20th century Western Europe.  Readings will be framed against the tumultuous historical backdrop of this period, characterized by technological and scientific innovation, the explosive rise of consumer culture, the so-called “scramble for Africa,” and two ravaging world wars.  In order to understand the body as a cultural artifact students will closely examine literary, medical, political, and visual primary texts and will draw on secondary materials from such diverse fields as literary criticism, social history, cultural anthropology, and cultural theory. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

This course offers a cross-cultural introduction to the issues involved in the study of women and gender.  Such an endeavor raises a number of difficult and delicate issues.  What explains the diversities and similarities in women's roles across societies?  How do we assess women's status and power, and how do we decide which standards to use in doing so?  What forces create changes in women's roles?  What is the relationship between gender constructions and the nature of communities, economies, and even nations?

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Race, Sex, and Power in the Lusophone World</strong><br />
How do race and sex intersect in the Lusophone world? What can they teach us about the power dynamics behind world-shaping events such as the Inquisition, colonialism, slavery, miscegenation, nationhood, and even plastic surgery? We will explore the connections between violence, racial identity, gender, and sexualityin the histories and cultures of Lusophone nations. Content covered will include literature, film, television, music, historical documents, and interdisciplinary scholarship that offer different insights into how racial and sexual discourses and practices shape or contest power structures. (PGSE 0215 or equivalent) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Women in French Historical Films: Looking at the Past through a Modern Lens</strong><br />
In this course we will focus on the representation of powerful women in French historical films produced since the early 1990s. At a time when the notion of gender parity was becoming prevalent in French political life, one would expect contemporary filmmakers to adopt a positive perspective on women in power. Yet, by studying such films as <em>La Reine Margot</em>, <em>Ridicule</em>, <em>Indochine</em>, and <em>Lucie Aubrac</em> and comparing them to various written accounts and/or literary texts, we will see that this is rarely the case. Historical films often offer as much information about the period when they were produced as they do about the period they depict, if not more. Could representations of powerful women in modern heritage films point to a general cultural tendency in late 20th century France to depreciate the notion of emancipation as a reaction to the very emergence of women in the political sphere? (Two courses among FREN 0210, FREN 0221, FREN 0230, or by waiver). 3 hrs lect/disc +2 hrs. screenings.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>A History of Gender in Early America</strong><br />
Exploration, conquest, settlement, revolution, and nation-building: no course in early American history should ignore such traditional topics. In this course, though, we will examine the various ways that gender shaped these historical processes. How, for example, did colonials’ assumptions about manhood and womanhood affect the development of slavery in America? Or how did the Founding Fathers’ identities as men inform their attitudes about democracy and citizenship? We will scrutinize historical documents, of both a private and public nature, and discuss several recent scholarly works on gender from 1600-1850 to consider these kinds of questions. Pre-1800. 2 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>iFeminism: Virality and Transnational Activism</strong><br />
With a focus on transnationally-circulating digital media, we will think through how feminist engagements are thickened by new technologies. Working with instances from across the world we will examine whether digital media users rewrite feminism, feminist practices, and activism. What are the creative ways in which virality has altered feminism, similarly and differently across the world? Informed by postcolonial theories, we will remain attentive to the global inequalities within which social media narratives circulate. Similarly, a theoretical engagement with the intersectional entanglements of power will ensure a comparative analysis of feminist activism that is engaged with regionally-specific concerns about power disparities. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Families, The State and Social Policy</strong><br />
In this course we will consider the range of family forms (including living alone) that exist in the United States and evaluate how social policy shapes the dynamics of different types of families.  We will be particularly attentive to variations in experience by gender, age, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, citizenship, and social class. Although the focus will be on contemporary United States, we will also examine some cross-cultural and historical material. (SOAN 0105 or SOAN 0212) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this course students will explore the fundamental principles of design thinking and creative innovation.  We will pursue all aspects of the design process, from discerning opportunities and researching solutions to developing concepts and generating prototypes.  We will explore design approaches from the renowned Bauhaus to those offered today by digital development and fabrication, including 3-D printing.  Students will participate in workshops, conduct individual projects, work in teams, and make presentations on implementing their designs.  We will also engage in discussions of how their designs affect the environmental and ethical aspects of our increasingly global and digital world. 3 hrs. lect]]></description>

This is a studio course that introduces its members to the values and methods used in the practice of architecture, landscape architecture, and environmental art.  A daily journal and intensive group and individual work within the studio space are requirements.  This course demands an exceptionally high commitment of time and energy. The course's goals are to use the process of design to gain insight regarding individual and community value systems, and to provide basic experience in the design professions.  It is recommended for anyone wishing to improve his or her appreciation for the built environment.  Students should anticipate that substantial additional time will be required in the studio in addition to the scheduled class time. 6 hrs. lect./lab]]></description>

This course will focus on the art produced in Italy during the late fourteenth through the early sixteenth centuries. In addition to studying the chronological development of painting, sculpture, and architecture, we will consider such issues as artistic training, patronage, domestic life, and the literary achievements of this period of "rebirth." Focusing on urban environments such as Florence, Siena, Padua, Venice, Rome, and Urbino, we will give special attention to the manner in which artistic production was shaped by place. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Potter, Painter, and Goldsmith: How Asian Art is Made</strong><br />
In this seminar, we will explore the manner in which the distinctive artistic traditions of China, Korea, and Japan were shaped by the materials and techniques available to ancient craftsmen.  Through observation of objects from the Middlebury Museum of Art, we will explore such questions as, “How was Asian art made?  Why it is made that way?  What was its historical impact?”  Topics will include jade and hardstones, bronze, textiles, ceramics, painting, lacquer, glass, and gold.   This course requires no prior experience in art history or Asian studies and is ideally suited to students who wish to learn more about art, Asian history, or conservation science.  3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Cities of Vesuvius</strong><br />
The Bay of Naples was an international cultural crossroads in antiquity. Prominent in Classical mythology and first colonized by the Greeks at Cumae and Neapolis, the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Baiae later flourished there, favored by the rich and powerful. We will study the history, arts, politics, religion, and commerce of these various cities, 800 BCE - 100 CE. Readings will include ancient authors in translation and secondary sources. The environment (geology, seismology) will receive special emphasis as it led to the cataclysmic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE, which doomed Pompeii and altered the landscape forever.  3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

In this course we will examine the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements that evolved in France during the second half of the 19th century.  Looking at artists such as Manet, Degas, Cassatt, and Monet, as well as Cézanne, Van Gogh, Seurat, and Gauguin, we will place their work in social and historical contexts that include the rise of the city, new opportunities for leisure, demographic change, and the breakdown of artistic establishments.  When appropriate we will compare visual artistic production to parallel developments in literature and music.  3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Producing Contemporary Art</strong><br />
In this project-based course, we will write, edit, design, and publish an art magazine. Through these varied elements of conceptualization and production, students will research aspects of contemporary art in the early 21st century, asking such questions as: Who decides what gets called “art”? How can we define—and how does one participate in—the art world? How do we, as consumers and critics, make sense of this shifting intellectual, cultural, and financial landscape? Through a combination of individual and collaborative work, we will both investigate and contribute to a vital sector of contemporary culture. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

Epic Asian tales such as India’s <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em>, Iran’s <em>Shahnameh</em>/, and China’s Journey to the West/ have inspired artists for centuries and continue to capture the imaginations of comic book artists today. In this seminar we will delve into the Asian classics and their many painted, sculpted, and printed interpretations in order to understand why artists depicted these compelling narratives in such drastically different ways. For the final project students will create their own one-shot comic based on an Asian short story or folktale.

In addition, students will gain a deeper understanding of the forms and style of Classical Hebrew, both of which are necessary for formal composition, interaction, and reading comprehension in Modern Hebrew. (HEBM 0103 or equivalent) 5 hrs. lect/disc]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Traveling in (and out of) the Holy Land: Israeli Tourism</strong><br />
Tourism is one of the most salient cultural phenomena in the post-World War II era and a main feature of modern life. In this course we will approach tourism from the Israeli perspective. Located at the juncture of Asia, Africa, and Europe and the birthplace of the three monotheistic religions, "The Holy Land", is an important site of pilgrimage and tourism. The diverse landscapes, pleasant weather, varied ethnic mosaic, Middle Eastern cuisine, and vibrant night life further contribute to the country's appeal. Yet Israel is also a hotspot of political disputes and the site of one of the longest standing conflicts of our era, scaring away many tourists, yet attracting others—interested in different kinds of "dark-tourism". Israelis themselves are big travelers, roaming the world individually and on tour-groups, carrying along their cultural traits and behavioral patterns. The lectures and readings for this course will outline the contemporary social theory of tourism and will analyze touristic practices in and of Israel and the Israelis.]]></description>

This course covers the history of Western Europe from the death of Caesar in 44 B.C. to the Peace of Westphalia in A.D. 1648. We will examine three interrelated themes: political authority within European society, the development of the religious culture of the West and the challenges to that culture, and the ways in which the development of a European economy contributed to the making of Europe itself. While examining these questions from the Roman Empire to early modern Europe, students will focus on the use of original sources, and on how historians interpret the past. Pre-1800.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Religion in America</strong><br />
America often has been defined paradoxically as both the "most religious" and "least religious" of nations. This course, a historical survey of American religious life, will trace the unique story of American religion from colonial times to the present. Guiding our exploration will be the ideas of "contact," "conflict," and "combination." Along the way, we will examine the varieties of religious experiences and traditions that have shaped and been shaped by American culture such as, Native American traditions, Puritan life and thought, evangelicalism, immigration, African-American religious experience, women's movements, and the on-going challenges of religious diversity.  Readings include sermons, essays, diaries and fiction, as well as secondary source material.  2 hrs. lect. 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Twentieth-Century America, 1960-2000</strong><br />
This course concentrates on the history of the United States from the emergence of JFK's New Frontier until the eve of September 11, 2001. In particular, we will focus on the ways in which domestic development shaped America's place within the international community, and vice versa. Topics to be considered include: the rise and fall of the post-1945 social welfare state, decolonization and the Vietnam War, increasing American investment in the Middle East, the emergence of the "New Right," the end of the Cold War, and globalization and its contexts.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>History of the American West</strong><br />
This is a survey of the history of the trans-Mississippi West from colonial contact through the 1980s. It explores how that region became known and understood as the West, and its role and meaning in United States history as a whole. The central themes of this course are conquest and its legacy, especially with regard to the role of the U.S. federal government in the West; human interactions with and perceptions of landscape and environment; social contests among different groups for a right to western resources and over the meanings of western identity; and the role of the West in American popular culture.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>History of the American West</strong><br />
This is a survey of the history of the trans-Mississippi West from colonial contact through the 1980s. It explores how that region became known and understood as the West, and its role and meaning in United States history as a whole. The central themes of this course are conquest and its legacy, especially with regard to the role of the U.S. federal government in the West; human interactions with and perceptions of landscape and environment; social contests among different groups for a right to western resources and over the meanings of western identity; and the role of the West in American popular culture.

In this course we will examine the history of China from the early 19th century through the end of the Maoist period. Readings, lectures, and discussions will familiarize students with the cultural and social structures of the late Qing Empire, patterns of semi-colonialism, the rise of nationalist, feminist, and Marxist movements, and key events in the People’s Republic of China. Students will emerge from the class with a broader understanding of forms of empire and imperialism, anti-colonial nationalism, non-Western Marxism, and the tendencies of a post-socialist state. 2 hrs. lect., 1 hr. disc.]]></description>

In this course we will map the emergence of Jewish minority culture into the modern Western political, economic, and social mainstream. Our course begins with the Jewish Haskalah (with a few short introductions to Jewish medieval and early modern history) and ends with Israel's founding in the early decades of its history. We will trace the following historical trends: the history of Jewish emancipation; assimilation; intellectual movements; Zionism; Jewish marginalization; race and gender as historical categories in Jewish history; urban and diasporic cultures; war and violence; and international politics in post-Holocaust Europe and the world. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>African Diasporas in the Modern World</strong><br />
In this course we will study the diversities and commonalities of African diaspora communities from a global perspective using prisms of nationhood, gender, and color throughout the Americas and Western Europe. With the help of diverse texts in multiple languages, we will study four themes: the invisibility/visibility of “black-ness” in the formulation of nationhood; cultural production [particularly music], resistance and accommodation in places as diverse as Paris and Lima; relationships to police, authority, and the justice system through court cases in places such as New York and Rio de Janeiro; and challenges of transnational movements from pan-Africanism to U.N. conferences against racism. Students will consult and compare texts in multiple languages and IGS majors will be encouraged to write one of the papers in Spanish, French or Portuguese and focus on comparisons using sources in one these languages. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

This course centers around the rise and fall of the Aztecs, the first state-level society encountered by the Spanish in 1519.  Although primarily known today for their military exploits for what today is Mexico, the Aztecs produced great artisans, artists, and philosophers whose contributions endure in contemporary Mexican culture. We will trace the origins and development of Aztec civilization to its encounter with the Spanish in 1519.  The course also covers the Spanish background for the Conquest, from the martial and political expulsion of Moors and Jews from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492 to the Spanish Inquisition. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

Topics covered will include: women's political identity, women's work, sexuality, access to education, the limits of "sisterhood" across racial and economic boundaries, and the opportunities women used to expand their sphere of influence. 3 hrs lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>A History of Gender in Early America</strong><br />
Exploration, conquest, settlement, revolution, and nation-building: no course in early American history should ignore such traditional topics. In this course, though, we will examine the various ways that gender shaped these historical processes. How, for example, did colonials’ assumptions about manhood and womanhood affect the development of slavery in America? Or how did the Founding Fathers’ identities as men inform their attitudes about democracy and citizenship? We will scrutinize historical documents, of both a private and public nature, and discuss several recent scholarly works on gender from 1600-1850 to consider these kinds of questions. Pre-1800. 2 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Readings in American History:  The Protest Impulse</strong><br />
An exploration of the protest impulse in American history, with particular attention given to the American Revolutionaries, Populists, and Civil Rights activists.  Among the key questions to be explored are:  What are the principal causes of insurgency?  What is the relationship between a leader and a protest movement?  Is there an American protest tradition?  Why are some insurgent groups more successful than others?  As these questions are discussed, we will examine the qualities of good scholarship, the role of theory in history, and the influence of political commitments on the shaping of interpretation.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Diplomacy and Modern South Asia</strong><br />
In this course we will examine current political and economic issues in the countries of South Asia - Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan. We will first examine the background of the South Asian region in general (pre-colonial and colonial eras) and of South Asian countries after independence. We will look at specific interstate and intrastate issues, focusing on the combined quests for political stability and economic development. Students will look at topical issues from the perspective of an officer working in a U.S. Embassy or in a U.S. foreign policy agency. The course will combine rigorous academic understanding of the region with current policy issues. Readings will include both academic studies and contemporary policy/issues papers. This course is equivalent to PSCI 0250. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>iFeminism: Virality and Transnational Activism</strong><br />
With a focus on transnationally-circulating digital media, we will think through how feminist engagements are thickened by new technologies. Working with instances from across the world we will examine whether digital media users rewrite feminism, feminist practices, and activism. What are the creative ways in which virality has altered feminism, similarly and differently across the world? Informed by postcolonial theories, we will remain attentive to the global inequalities within which social media narratives circulate. Similarly, a theoretical engagement with the intersectional entanglements of power will ensure a comparative analysis of feminist activism that is engaged with regionally-specific concerns about power disparities. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Political Economy of Regionalism *<br />
In this course we will address the political economy of regionalism in a variety of national and regional contexts.  We will consider both integration projects—such as the European Union and South America’s Mercosur—as well as subnational local autonomy movements, such as those in Catalonia and Scotland.  We will study theories of integration as well as case studies from Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, focusing on the political and economic forces driving both integration and disintegration in their historical and contemporary contexts.  We will also consider how globalization affects regional integration projects. /(Comparative Politics)/ 3 hrs. sem.</strong>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sophomore Seminar in the Liberal Arts</strong><br />
This course is designed for sophomores who are interested in exploring the meaning and the purpose of a liberal arts education. To frame this investigation, we will use the question "What is the good life and how shall I live it?" Through an interdisciplinary and multicultural array of readings and films we will engage our course question through intellectual discussion, written reflection, and personal practice. There will be significant opportunities for public speaking and oral presentation, as well as regular writing assignments, including a formal poster presentation.  Readings will include reflections on a liberal arts education in the U.S. (Emerson, Brann, Nussbaum, Oakeshott, Ladsen-Billings, bell hooks); on "the good life" (excerpts from Aristotle, sacred texts of different traditions); on social science analyses of contemporary life; texts on the neuroscience of happiness; as well as literary and cinematic representations of lives well-lived.

An organization, be it a business, a social enterprise, a school or a country, must be managed. In this course we will explore management theory and its practical applications. The course will focus on several highly relevant and timely management issues, giving students both a sound basis for understanding management and also experience with real-world management situations. The course will consist of two components. One component surveys the history and development of management theory, management functions, management roles and skills, and management organization, structures and behavior. The second component focuses on practical management techniques and skills including problem solving, teamwork, and communications. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Enterprise, Social Entrepreneurship, and the Liberal Arts</strong><br />
In this course we will explore how to translate the skills and knowledge learned in liberal arts courses to the skills and knowledge used in various forms of enterprises. The course will consist of three parts. In the first part we will discuss the role and nature of college education and how it relates, or does not relate, to getting a job. In the second part we will discuss the nature of enterprise, business, and entrepreneurship, considering how social entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship relate. Finally, in the third part students will complete a set of self-directed exercises to gain an overview of the introduction to the specific skills they will need in the future.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sounds of Childhood</strong><br />
This innovative course combines the academic study of childhood with the skills of sound production. Students will produce short sound pieces that explore the course’s main theme: the social construction of childhood.  Childhood is an invented concept: prior to the 16th century, the idea of “child” as distinct from “adult” did not exist. Since that time, literature, history, sociology and psychology have helped to articulate the now distinct category “child.” We will read histories of childhood and literature from the 19th -21st centuries that represents childhood’s developing articulation in fiction. We will explore the sociology of childhood, including its raced, classed, and gendered dimensions, to see the variety of childhoods that simultaneously exist. We will engage with psychology to examine the inner life and emotional constructions of young people as they navigate the institutions that structure their life experiences. These academic explorations will culminate in an original research-oriented sound piece that explores historical or contemporary constructions of childhood and a public listening event that will showcase student work.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Producing Contemporary Art</strong><br />
In this project-based course, we will write, edit, design, and publish an art magazine. Through these varied elements of conceptualization and production, students will research aspects of contemporary art in the early 21st century, asking such questions as: Who decides what gets called “art”? How can we define—and how does one participate in—the art world? How do we, as consumers and critics, make sense of this shifting intellectual, cultural, and financial landscape? Through a combination of individual and collaborative work, we will both investigate and contribute to a vital sector of contemporary culture. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Middlebury's Foodprint:  Introduction to Food Systems Issues</strong><br />
Food systems encompass all activities, people and institutions determining movement of food from input supply and production (on land and water) through waste management.  The dominant U.S. food system is responsible at least in part for some of the nation’s most troubling environmental and health challenges.  What do we eat at Middlebury? What difference does it make? How do we know? We'll read Chase & Grubinger's <em>Food, Farms, and Community: Exploring Food Systems</em> (2015), then dive into examining impacts of how Middlebury sources and consumes its food, and disposes of food waste. (BIOL 0140 recommended) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Privilege and Poverty: The Ethics of Economic Inequality</strong><br />
In this course we will study the ethical implications of domestic and global economic inequality.  Drawing from history, economics, sociology, philosophy, theology, and other disciplines, we will examine the causes and consequences of inequality, critically evaluate our usage of the terms “privilege” and “poverty,” and consider the range of moral responses individuals and society might have to inequality.  We will ask whether it is unfair, unfortunate, or necessary that some citizens live with significantly less material wealth than others, and whether those who experience “privilege” have any moral responsibility to those who exist in “poverty.”]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Accounting, Budgeting, and the Liberal Arts</strong><br />
Accounting is the lingua franca of commercial and financial activity, and applies equally to corporations, non-profits, and governments. In this course we will learn the basic concepts and standards underlying the accounting language including: revenue recognition, inventory, long-lived assets, present value, long-term liabilities, and financial statements.  We then turn to the application and use of accounting information in forecasting, operating, and measuring an enterprise.  These managerial accounting concepts are used to develop budgets and evaluate results. Our understanding of accounting and financial statements is needed to understand how business interrelates with society, and to answer a range of economic questions such as new product profitability, how to measure and motivate staff and predicting whether Chicago will follow Detroit into bankruptcy.   There will be a significant project to apply the concepts and tools we have developed. (ECON 0155) 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Accounting, Budgeting, and the Liberal Arts</strong><br />
Accounting is the lingua franca of commercial and financial activity, and applies equally to corporations, non-profits, and governments. In this course we will learn the basic concepts and standards underlying the accounting language including: revenue recognition, inventory, long-lived assets, present value, long-term liabilities, and financial statements.  We then turn to the application and use of accounting information in forecasting, operating, and measuring an enterprise.  These managerial accounting concepts are used to develop budgets and evaluate results. Our understanding of accounting and financial statements is needed to understand how business interrelates with society, and to answer a range of economic questions such as new product profitability, how to measure and motivate staff and predicting whether Chicago will follow Detroit into bankruptcy.   There will be a significant project to apply the concepts and tools we have developed. (ECON 0155) 3 hrs. lect., 1 hr. lab]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Hunger, Food Security, & Food Sovereignty</strong><br />
Why have no countries—including the U.S.—been able to ensure universal food security, even though more than enough food is produced for everyone? To examine this question, we will analyze historical famines, the "food price crisis" of 2008, and debates about how to address hunger and food insecurity including calls for food sovereignty.  We will read Julian Cribb's <em>The Coming Famine</em> as well as other sources. Students will select international or domestic food security as their emphasis, and examine an organization trying to tackle hunger and food insecurity.  This course is open to juniors and seniors. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

This course is an introduction to the Italian language that provides a foundation in both spoken and written Italian. Focus on the spoken language encourages rapid mastery of the basic structures and vocabulary of contemporary Italian. The exclusive use of Italian in dialogue situations and vocabulary building encourages the student to develop skills in a personalized context. Conversation and drill are stimulated and fostered through active reference to popular Italian music, authentic props, and slides of Italian everyday life and culture. Students are required to participate in the Italian table. 6 hrs. disc./perf.; 2 hrs. screen]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Italian Family</strong><br />
Recent sociological analyses indicate that in Europe, family solidarity still remains strongest in Italy. The Italian family offers positive benefits, as the wide-spread image of close-knit, multigenerational families suggests.  However, recent studies also demonstrate negative results, occasioned by adult children’s long dependence on the family, power struggles between matriarchs and patriarchs, and a relatively closed attitude toward blending Italian families with those of other ethnicities and races. How did Italian families evolve from the early 20th century to the present?  Supported by historical and social science analyses, modern and contemporary literature and film will provide the focus of our explorations. (ITAL 0252 or equivalent) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Tale of Genji (in English)</strong><br />
/The Tale of Genji/ is the world’s first psychological novel. This rich narrative centers on the political intrigues and passionate love affairs of Genji, a fictional prince barred from the throne.  In this course we will explore the narrative through a close reading in English translation. Students will gain knowledge of the aesthetic, religious, and social contexts of the Heian period, one of the most vibrant eras in Japanese culture. We will also trace how <em>Genji monogatari</em> has been interpreted over ten centuries in art, theater, films, and  most recently, manga.  (Formerly JAPN 0190) 3hrs. lect/disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Global Japanese Culture (in English)</strong><br />
In this course we will examine the transformation of Japanese cultural identity (Japanese-ness) as products, ideas, and people move across the borders in and out of Japan. Social scientists have been particularly interested in the Japanizing of non-Japanese practices and products such as hip hop and hamburgers, as well as the popularity of Japanese styles and products on the global scene. We will take an anthropological approach using texts such as <em>Millennial Monsters</em>, <em>Remade in Japan</em>, and <em>Hip Hop Japan</em> to examine the issues of cultural hybridity, identity, and globalization.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Jewish Tradition</strong><br />
How did monotheism emerge in the ancient Middle East? What did God command the Jews to do? (And when God spoke, were they already Jews?)  How did they transform this message into a tradition that has endured over two millennia?  In this course we will study the tension between preservation and innovation in the Jewish tradition by exploring ritual, practice, classical texts, and their interpretations: Bible, Mishnah, Talmud, Midrash, medieval philosophy (Maimonides), poetry (Halevi), and mysticism (Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah). 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

In this course we will examine Israeli society and politics in a period of rapid and profound transformation.  We will begin with an introductory unit on Zionism, Palestinian nationalism, and the history of the state. Subsequent units will examine the social, cultural, and political characteristics of Israel’s main population sectors (European, Middle Eastern, Russian, and Ethiopian Jews and Palestinian citizens of the state) and religious groupings (Muslims and Jews, including secular, traditional, national-religious, and ultra-Orthodox). The final units will examine ongoing political struggles that will shape the future of the state, including struggles over the role of religion in public life; civil rights and democracy; and West Bank settlements and the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. Most readings assignments will be social scientific or historical in nature, but will also include some journalism and literature. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Jews in Modern Europe</strong><br />
In this course we will map the emergence of Jewish minority culture into the modern Western political, economic, and social mainstream. Our course begins with the Jewish Haskalah (with a few short introductions to Jewish medieval and early modern history) and ends with Israel's founding in the early decades of its history. We will trace the following historical trends: the history of Jewish emancipation; assimilation; intellectual movements; Zionism; Jewish marginalization; race and gender as historical categories in Jewish history; urban and diasporic cultures; war and violence; and international politics in post-Holocaust Europe and the world. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Diasporas and Homelands</strong><br />
War, mass migration, and globalization have spurred development of diaspora communities and heightened scholarly interest in the phenomenon.  In contrast to other groups of exiles and immigrants, diaspora communities seek integration within host countries as well as ongoing political, economic, and cultural ties to their homelands. A number of questions arise from these complex and dynamic relationships: How do diaspora communities maintain cultural distinctiveness within host countries? How do they maintain and reproduce cultural ties with homelands and other centers of diaspora life? What influence do diaspora communities have on political relationships between host countries and homelands? What influence do they have on internal homeland politics? Finally, what are the implications of the diaspora phenomenon for the future of the nation state and globalization? Case studies will be drawn from a variety of diaspora communities, including Armenians, Nigerians, Jews, Palestinians, Dominicans, and South Asians. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to College Latin</strong><br />
This course is designed for students with one to four years of high school Latin who are interested in continuing their study of the language. The course combines review of grammar and practice in translation; the aim is to improve reading skills and understanding of the language. Students may expect to join a 0200- or 0300-level Latin course the following spring. We will use both a textbook and readings from authors such as Cicero and Livy. (Prerequisites: Students should have had some formal study of Latin and should consult with the instructor during orientation week or the first week of classes to determine whether or not the class is at the appropriate level.) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Cultural Crossings: Studies in Literary Influence</strong><br />
Centered on a range of provocative works conceived at different historical moments and in different cultural situations, this course will explore some of the persistent imaginative preoccupations and far-reaching literary ambitions that serve to link authors working in a wide variety of genres and traditions. Authors to be considered this semester will include Jonathan Swift, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Petronius, Thomas Carlyle,  Herman Melville, Ivan Turgenev, Ernest Hemingway, Gustave Flaubert, Gertrude Stein, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Saul Bellow. Depending on individual backgrounds and interests, students may be encouraged to undertake independent comparisons between some of the author’s works we are reading and works by other authors not included on this spring's list. 3 hr. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Chinese Sociolinguistics (taught in English)</strong><br />
Sociolinguistics is mainly concerned with the interaction of language and society. The language situation in China is unique both in the modern world and in human history. We will gain a good understanding of sociolinguistics as a scientific field of inquiry through exploring the Chinese situation in this course. Some of the questions we will ask are: What is Mandarin (Modern Standard) Chinese? Who are "native speakers" of Mandarin? Are most Chinese people monolingual (speaking only one language) or bilingual (speaking two languages) or even multilingual? How many "dialects" are there in China? What is the difference between a "language" and a "dialect"? Are Chinese characters "ideographs", i.e., "pictures" that directly represent meaning and have nothing to do with sound? Why has the pinyin romanization system officially adopted in the 1950s never supplanted the Chinese characters? Why are there traditional and simplified characters? We will also explore topics such as power, register, verbal courtesy, gender and language use. Students are encouraged to compare the Chinese situation with societies that they are familiar with. (One semester of Chinese language study or by waiver)]]></description>

In this course we will study the sound system of Spanish with the aims of introducing the fields of phonetics and phonology while improving pronunciation. Students will become familiar with phonetic transcription, comparing and contrasting articulatory and acoustic characteristics of Spanish as well as English in order to understand and implement different phonological patterns produced by native speakers of Spanish. Additionally, we will discuss major pronunciation differences across the Spanish-speaking world. (SPAN 0220 or placement) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

This course is an introduction to both linguistic anthropology and political anthropology.  Communication patterns are always mediated by cultural processes, social inequality, and power, so in this course we will investigate cross-cultural examples of how language, discourse, and representation relate to inequality, power, and resistance.  Topics will include sociolinguistics, ethnolinguistics, gendered language practices, political discourse, and theoretical approaches to power (Marx, Foucault, and Bourdieu) (SOAN 0103 or SOAN 0105 or LNGT 0102) 3hrs. lect./disc.

How long will oil last? What is the fairest voting system? How can we harvest food and other resources sustainably? To explore such real-world questions we will study a variety of mathematical ideas and methods, including modeling, logical analysis, discrete dynamical systems, and elementary statistics. This is an alternative first mathematics course for students not pursuing the calculus sequence in their first semester. The only prerequisite is an interest in exploring contemporary issues using the mathematics that lies within those issues. (Approval required; This course is not open to students who have had a prior course in calculus or statistics.) 3 hrs lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Mathematics for Teachers</strong><br />
What mathematical knowledge should elementary and secondary teachers have in the 21st century? Participants in this course will strengthen and deepen their own mathematical understanding in a student-centered workshop setting. We will investigate the number system, operations, algebraic thinking, measurement, data, and functions, and consider the attributes of quantitative literacy. We will also study recent research that describes specialized mathematical content knowledge for teaching. (Not open to students who have taken MATH/EDST 1005. Students looking for a course in elementary school teaching methods should consider EDST 0315 instead.)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Elements of Mathematical Biology and Ecology</strong><br />
Mathematical modeling has become an essential tool in biology and ecology. In this course we will investigate several fundamental biological and ecological models. We will learn how to analyze existing models and how to construct new models. We will develop ecological and evolutionary models that describe how biological systems change over time. Models for population growth, predator-prey interactions, competing species, the spread of infectious disease, and molecular evolution will be studied. Students will be introduced to differential and difference equations, multivariable calculus, and linear and non-linear dynamical systems.  (MATH 0121 or by waiver)]]></description>

This course is a tutorial in Advanced Abstract Algebra and Number Theory for students who have completed work in either subject.  Starting from elementary results in linear algebra, we will explore the fundamental mathematical ideas underlying field extensions, constructability, unique factorization, Euclidean fields, and Galois theory. Working independently and in small groups, students will gain experience reading advanced sources and communicating their insights in expository writing and oral presentations.  This course fulfills the capstone senior work requirement for the mathematics major. (MATH 0241 or MATH 0302; Approval required) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Music I</strong><br />
Music I focuses on the materials and grammar of music through compositional exercises. As part of these explorations, we will examine the elements of harmony (scales, triads and seventh chords), notation, rhythm, polyrhythm, binary and ternary forms, two-voice counterpoint, variation, transposition, as well as skills in conducting, analysis, ear-training, and sight-singing. Students will write short pieces for a variety of instruments and ensembles, notate their pieces, and rehearse and perform them, thereby learning about music through discovery and observation. The assignments are designed for students with or without compositional experience. (Ability to play an instrument or sing; MUSC 0160, or passing score on the MUSC 0160 placement exam) 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. lab.]]></description>

This course is an in-depth technical study of the materials of music, a study which expands one’s ability to analyze and create music and to understand different musical styles.  We will cover harmonic materials, introduce musical form, and work with traditional compositional skills. These techniques are applied to the analysis of classical music, jazz and popular music. (MUSC 0160 or passing score on the MUSC 0160 placement exam.)  3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Advanced Composition</strong><br />
In this course we will focus on writing for string quartet, brass quintet, a cappella singing, piano, or performance art and involve issues of technique, style, and practical considerations, as well as study of selected elements of the literature. The course will culminate with a reading of student works by a professional ensemble or solo performer. This semester we focus on composing for the string quartet. We will discuss a variety of string techniques as well as issues of form and orchestration. We will listen to important works for that medium and discuss the styles from the Classical period to this century. Students will compose exercises, leading to a substantial string quartet to be "read" by the Jupiter String Quartet. (MUSC 0209 and 0210 or approval of instructor). 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Music History I: Music to 1750</strong><br />
In this course we will survey Western art music from the earliest notated Medieval music through the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Beginning with Gregorian chant and troubadour song, we will explore Renaissance vocal polyphony, the development of opera and instrumental music in the 17th century, and the late Baroque music of Bach and Handel. Analysis of the music is supplemented by consideration of the ways in which music relates to the other arts and reflects the history and culture of its time. Students will be introduced to musicological research methods and their connection to other ways of thinking about music. Through score study, reading, writing, and discussion, they will confront the challenges surrounding our attempt to understand music’s historical development and its relation to the other arts and society. (MUSC 0261 or waiver) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sensation and Perception</strong><br />
Remarkably, using just five basic senses, our brains translate simple external stimuli (e.g. light and sound waves) into unique and vivid perceptual experiences enabling us to interact with our surrounding physical reality.  Focusing primarily on the underlying mechanisms of vision and audition, we will explore how our brains construct detailed representations of our world.  Throughout these explorations, we will identify perceptual limitations and investigate how mental processes such as attention and emotion affect our perceptions.  We will review recent scientific articles and conduct experiments.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong><br />
Questions about the nature of the mind, thinking, and knowledge have a long and rich history in the field of psychology. This course will examine the theoretical perspectives and empirically documented phenomena that inform our current understanding of cognition. Lectures, discussions, demonstrations, and experiments will form the basis for our explorations of cognition in this class. Topics to be considered include attention, perception, memory, knowledge, problem solving, and decision making. (PSYC 0105; PSYC 0201 or MATH 0116 or ECON 0210 previously or concurrently; PSYC 0202 recommended; not open to first-year students; open to psychology and neuroscience majors; others by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./1.5 hrs. lab.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Lenses on Sex and Gender</strong><br />
Where do sex and gender come from, and what difference do they make?  In this course we will address these questions using social psychological and neuroscientific/hormonal perspectives. We will investigate gender identity, stereotyping, and power, and will explore issues of sex and gender in multiple contexts, including childhood socialization and play, sexual orientation and attraction, close relationships and affiliation, cognition, the workplace, and mental health. Students will learn to think critically about these issues as portrayed in academic and popular discourse. (PSYC 0105; Open to junior and senior psychology; neuroscience; and gender, sexuality, and feminist studies majors only; not open to students who have taken PSYC/GSFS 0330) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

How do race and sex intersect in the Lusophone world? What can they teach us about the power dynamics behind world-shaping events such as the Inquisition, colonialism, slavery, miscegenation, nationhood, and even plastic surgery? We will explore the connections between violence, racial identity, gender, and sexualityin the histories and cultures of Lusophone nations. Content covered will include literature, film, television, music, historical documents, and interdisciplinary scholarship that offer different insights into how racial and sexual discourses and practices shape or contest power structures.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Modern Logic</strong><br />
Logic is concerned with good reasoning; as such, it stands at the core of the liberal arts. In this course we will develop our reasoning skills by identifying and analyzing arguments found in philosophical, legal, and other texts, and also by formulating our own arguments. We will use the formal techniques of modern propositional and predicate logic to codify and test various reasoning strategies and specific arguments. No prior knowledge of logic, formal mathematics, or computer science is presupposed in this course, which does not count towards the PHL distribution requirement but instead towards the deductive reasoning requirement.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Ancient Greek Philosophy</strong><br />
This class introduces students to the range and power of Greek thought, which initiated the Western philosophical tradition. We will begin by exploring the origins of philosophy as found in myth (primarily Hesiod) and in the highly original speculation of the Pre-Socratic thinkers (such as Heraclitus and Parmenides). We will then focus on Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, examining their transformations of these earlier traditions and their own divergent approaches to ethics and education. We will also consider the influences of Greek philosophy on later thought. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

We will examine a selection of pressing moral problems of our day, seeking to understand the substance of the issues and learning how moral arguments work. We will focus on developing our analytical skills, which we can then use to present and criticize arguments on difficult moral issues. Selected topics may include world poverty, animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, human rights, just and unjust wars, capital punishment, and racial and gender issues. You will be encouraged to question your own beliefs on these issues, and in the process to explore the limit and extent to which ethical theory can play a role in everyday ethical decision making. 2 hrs.lect./1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Science and Society</strong><br />
Scientific theories are not developed in a vacuum. Social circumstances influence the practice of science, and science, in turn, influences how we organize ourselves as a society. This course will investigate both directions of the relationship between science and society. We will ask such questions as: how do the values of society drive scientific research? What do we mean when we claim that science is 'objective' and what do we expect of an objective science? Can there be 'good' politically-motivated science, or does this conflict with the norms of 'good' science? How important is science as a way of bettering society? Do scientists bear an extra burden of responsibility when they generate scientific results of particular social significance (such as the development of the atomic bomb, or the development of techniques of cloning)? We will examine particular cases of socially significant scientific research, and we will consider larger philosophical questions concerning the status of science, given its interconnections with society. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Philosophy and Feminism</strong><br />
This course will examine the contributions of various feminists and feminist philosophers to some of the central problems of philosophical methodology, epistemology, philosophy of science, metaphysics, and ethics. Are there gendered assumptions in operation in the way particular philosophical problems are framed? For example, do the politics of gender contribute to accounts of objective knowledge and rationality? Are some philosophical perspectives better suited to the goals of feminism than others? We will also examine the general relationship between feminism and philosophy, and we will reflect on the relevance of theorizing and philosophizing for feminist political practice.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Idea of the Ethical</strong><br />
What is the basis for morality? The great turning point of the history of modern European philosophy, particularly ethical philosophy, came at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century with Kant's new account of the possibility of moral philosophy and Hegel's critique of that account. In this course, we shall investigate Kant's moral philosophy and Hegel's response to it, and then we will consider the ways in which a series of major thinkers attempted to rethink the idea of the ethical in the light of this dispute. We will consider Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Marx, Emerson, and Nietzsche and conclude with an account of 20th century developments. (Some prior work in philosophy would be useful background) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Philosophy & Literature</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the border both separating and joining philosophy and literature. How does literature evoke philosophical problems, and how do philosophers interpret such works? How does fiction create meaning? Beginning with Greek tragedy, we investigate Plato’s “quarrel” with, and Aristotle’s defense of, poetry. Then we will turn to modern works, mostly European, on topics such as: tragedy and ethics; style and rhetoric; author and reader; time and temporality; mood and emotion; existence and mortality. Literary readings after Sophocles will be selected from Borges, Calvino, Camus, Kafka, Tolstoy, and Woolf.  Philosophical readings after Plato and Aristotle will be selected from Bergson, Danto, Freud, Murdoch, Ricoeur, and Nussbaum. Not open to students who have taken PHIL/CMLT 1014.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar in Metaphysics and Epistemology</strong><br />
In this course, we will explore a specific topic in either epistemology (the philosophical study of knowledge), metaphysics (the philosophical study of reality), or the intersection thereof. Possible epistemological topics include specific theories of knowledge (foundationalism, coherentism, externalism, internalism, contextualism, etc.), skepticism, different sources of knowledge (perception, inference, testimony, a priori, etc.), the nature of representation, and the value of knowledge. Possible metaphysical topics include whether various entities (possibilities, universals, time) exist independently of our minds, theories of truth, and theories of causation. Points of intersection include the epistemologies characteristic of different metaphysical domains. Readings will be mostly contemporary. (Junior and senior majors, or by waiver) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>An Introduction to the Universe</strong><br />
Our universe comprises billions of galaxies in a rapidly expanding fabric. How did it begin? Will it expand forever, or how may it end? How do the stars that compose the galaxies evolve from their births in clouds of gas, through the tranquility of middle age, to their often violent deaths? How can scientists even hope to answer such cosmic questions from our vantage point on a small planet, orbiting a very ordinary star? Are there other planets, orbiting other stars, where intelligent beings may be pondering similar issues? This introductory astronomy course, designed for nonscience majors, will explore these and other questions. Students will also become familiar with the night sky, both as part of our natural environment and as a scientific resource, through independent observations and sessions at the College Observatory. The approach requires no college-level mathematics, but students should expect to do quantitative calculations using scientific notation and occasionally to use elementary high-school algebra. (Students may not receive credit for both PHYS 0155 and PHYS 0165.) 3 hrs. lect./ hrs. lab./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Mathematica</strong><br />
Mathematica is a scientific software application that consists of a flexible high-level programming language with thousands of powerful built-in functions for symbolic, numeric, and graphical computation typical of physics and other quantitative fields.  Undergraduates can use Mathematica for coursework, senior projects, and throughout their professional careers.  In this course we will focus on the principles at the core of Mathematica and how these principles unify such a great range of computational capabilities. (PHYS 0109 and 0110; Recommended: MATH 0200 and a traditional “computer programming course” in high school or college)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Biomedical Imaging</strong><br />
Why do we use microscopes for thin tissue slices but x-rays for imaging through the entire body? In this course we will explore the physics of light and life through various biomedical imaging techniques. We will apply the fundamental imaging concepts of resolution, aberration, diffraction, scattering, the Fourier transform, and deconvolution. Most of the course will focus on biomedical optics, including standard optical microscopes, fluorescence imaging, spectroscopy, fiber-optic endoscopes, and laser-scanning microscopes. The latter part of the course will cover non-optical imaging, such as ultrasound, x-ray, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Students will gain hands-on experience through field trips to a local hospital and the use of the Cell Imaging Facility in McCardell Bicentennial Hall. (PHYS 0111; PHYS 0212 or MATH 0223) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

The unified description of electricity and magnetism is one of the greatest triumphs of physics. This course provides a thorough grounding in the nature of electric and magnetic fields and their interaction with matter. Mathematical techniques appropriate to the solution of problems in electromagnetism are also introduced. The primary emphasis is on static fields, with the full time-dependent Maxwell equations and electromagnetic waves introduced in the final part of the course.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Statistical Mechanics</strong><br />
The course opens with a review of classical thermodynamics and continues with an examination of the fundamental concepts of probability, statistics, and distribution functions. These topics are followed by in-depth discussion of the concepts of energy, energy quantization, and the application of these concepts to the modeling of macroscopic systems. The remainder of the course is a study of statistical mechanics and its application to a variety of classical and quantum systems. Topics covered include statistical thermodynamics, Maxwellian distributions, imperfect gases, equipartition theorem, quantum statistics, heat capacities of solids, electromagnetic radiation, and ideal quantum gases. (PHYS 0202 and PHYS 0212) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Comparative Politics</strong><br />
This course offers an introduction to the comparative study of political systems and to the logic of comparative inquiry. How are different political systems created and organized? How and why do they change? Why are some democratic and others authoritarian? Why are some rich and others poor? Other topics covered in this course include nationalism and political ideologies, forms of representation, the relationship between state institutions and civil society, and globalization. The goal in this course is to use comparative methods to analyze questions of state institutions -- how they arise, change, and generate different economic, social, and political outcome. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(Comparative Politics)</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to American Politics</strong><br />
This course introduces the institutions and practices of American government and politics. The aim is to give students a firm understanding of the workings of and the balance of power among the American Congress, President, bureaucracy, and court system. We begin with the Constitution, which provides the set of founding principles upon which the American government is based. We then look at how American citizens make decisions about politics. Finally, we examine how political institutions, interest groups, parties, elections, and legislative bodies and rules aggregate diverse, often conflicting preferences and how they resolve or exacerbate problems. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(American Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Politics</strong><br />
What causes conflict or cooperation among states? What can states and other international entities do to preserve global peace? These are among the issues addressed by the study of international politics. This course examines the forces that shape relations among states, and between states and international regimes. Key concepts include: the international system, power and the balance of power, international institutions, foreign policy, diplomacy, deterrence, war, and global economic issues. Both the fall and spring sections of this course emphasize rigorous analysis and set theoretical concepts against historical and contemporary case studies.  3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(International Relations and Foreign Policy)/</em>]]></description>

What causes conflict or cooperation among states? What can states and other international entities do to preserve global peace? These are among the issues addressed by the study of international politics. This course examines the forces that shape relations among states, and between states and international regimes. Key concepts include: the international system, power and the balance of power, international institutions, foreign policy, diplomacy, deterrence, war, and global economic issues. Both the fall and spring sections of this course emphasize rigorous analysis and set theoretical concepts against historical and contemporary case studies.  3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(International Relations and Foreign Policy)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Conservation and Environmental Policy</strong><br />
This course examines conservation and environmental policy in the United States. In order to better understand the current nature of the conservation and environmental policy process, we will begin by tracing the development of past ideas, institutions, and policies related to this policy arena. We will then focus on contemporary conservation and environmental politics and policy making—gridlock in Congress, interest group pressure, the role of the courts and the president, and a move away from national policy making—toward the states, collaboration, and civil society. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(American Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Conservation and Environmental Policy</strong><br />
This course examines conservation and environmental policy in the United States. In order to better understand the current nature of the conservation and environmental policy process, we will begin by tracing the development of past ideas, institutions, and policies related to this policy arena. We will then focus on contemporary conservation and environmental politics and policy making—gridlock in Congress, interest group pressure, the role of the courts and the president, and a move away from national policy making—toward the states, collaboration, and civil society. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(American Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The European Union</strong><br />
The European integration project was launched in the aftermath of World War II as a means of making war between European states impossible. By the 1970s, this romantic aspiration for an ever closer union of Europeans gave way to a project focused on enhancing the global competitiveness of Europe's economies. This course investigates the tension between these two visions of an integrated Europe by focusing on the historical evolution of the European Community and its institutions, practical and conceptual problems encountered in the integration process, current problems of economic and monetary union and the recent enlargement to Eastern Europe. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(International Relations and Foreign Policy)/</em>]]></description>

Contrary to common perceptions, most West European populations are no longer overwhelmingly white and Christian.  The new diversity prompted by post-World War II immigration has generated opportunities and challenges for European societies.  In this course, we will examine how ethnic diversity is affecting contemporary West European politics.  We will cover the topics of citizenship, immigration, immigrant integration, the rise of far right parties, and state policies toward Europe's new ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse societies.  3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(Comparative Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Diplomacy and Modern South Asia</strong><br />
In this course we will examine current political and economic issues in the countries of South Asia - Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan. We will first examine the background of the South Asian region in general (pre-colonial and colonial eras) and of South Asian countries after independence. We will look at specific interstate and intrastate issues, focusing on the combined quests for political stability and economic development. Students will look at topical issues from the perspective of an officer working in a U.S. Embassy or in a U.S. foreign policy agency. The course will combine rigorous academic understanding of the region with current policy issues. Readings will include both academic studies and contemporary policy/issues papers. This course is equivalent to IGST 0250. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(International Relations and Foreign Policy)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Power and Violence in America: An Historical Approach to Politics</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the complex relationship between industrialization, the labor movement, race relations, and the organization of violence in America.  It will focus on the transformative year of 1877, which saw the end of Reconstruction, as well as the first nation-wide strike in American history.  In studying this 'Great Upheaval,' students will encounter fundamental questions concerning the distribution of income and the use of force in American society.  We will examine the historical processes that preceded the events of 1877, as well as the indelible mark that these events left on American political development in the 20th century. This course is being taught simultaneously at Amherst College and will include a virtual classroom component as well as opportunities for inter-collegiate collaboration. 3 hrs. sem. <em>(American Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Political Communication</strong><br />
How are media and communications technology re-shaping politics?  From a global comparative perspective—ranging from the United States to the Middle East and to Asia—this course will survey the historical development of communications, the role of media in shaping public opinion and behavior, the impact of new media, and the rise of transnational satellite TV.  Conceptually, the course will assess the importance of communications for understanding authoritarianism, democracy, and foreign policy.  We will develop general comparative frameworks for understanding the growing importance of communications in the information age, while clarifying the limitations of media for shaping polities. (This course is not open to students who have taken PSCI 0413) 3 hrs. lect. <em>(Comparative Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>U.S.-Latin American Relations</strong><br />
This course examines American foreign policy toward Latin America. Grounded in international relations theory, it chronicles the expansion of U.S. power in the nineteenth century, the interwar period, the Cold War, and the current era of continental economic integration. To ensure rigorous analysis the course sets theoretical concepts against specific case studies. Topics include the Inter-American System, specific doctrines (Monroe Doctrine, Roosevelt Corollary), specific policies (Good Neighbor Policy, Alliance for Progress), and milestone events in U.S.-Latin American relations, including the Cuban missile crisis, Falkland Islands War, and North American Free Trade Agreement. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <br />

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Political Economy</strong><br />
This course examines the politics of global economic relations, focusing principally on the advanced industrial states. How do governments and firms deal with the forces of globalization and interdependence? And what are the causes and consequences of their actions for the international system in turn? The course exposes students to both classic and contemporary thinking on free trade and protectionism, exchange rates and monetary systems, foreign direct investment and capital movements, regional integration, and the role of international institutions like the WTO. Readings will be drawn mainly from political science, as well as law and economics. (PSCI 0109) 3 hrs. lect./disc. <br />

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>American Constitutional Law: The Federal System</strong><br />
This course examines the development of American constitutionalism through study of Supreme Court decisions. Every major topic but the bill of rights (see PSCI 0306) is covered. Using the Sullivan and Gunther Constitutional Law casebook, we begin with judicial review and then study the development of legal doctrines surrounding the commerce clause, the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment, and the separation of powers. Recent cases focus on affirmative action and federal protection of civil rights. Interpretive books and essays are considered, as time permits. A mock court exercise is anticipated. (Juniors and seniors with PSCI 0102 or PSCI 0104 or PSCI 0306) 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(American Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Politics of Virtual Realities</strong><br />
How has technology changed our politics? Are those changes all for the good? In this course we will explore the political, legal, and normative implications of the Internet for liberal democracy. We start with the US Constitution and explore arguments that it cannot by itself prevent the Internet from becoming a domain of manipulation rather than of freedom. How can we uphold the ideals of liberty and equality? And, since cyberspace has no country, whose laws should govern it? Cases will include President Obama's campaign and governance strategies, Google's activities abroad, cybersecurity, virtual war, and the WikiLeaks controversy.  3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(International Relations and Foreign Policy)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>American Foreign Policy</strong><br />
Does America exercise its power in the world in a distinctive way? If yes, has it always done so? In this course we will examine the evolution of American foreign policy from the time of the founding to the present. As we make our way from the height of the Cold War to the 21st century, we will assess how leaders, institutions, domestic politics, and the actions and inactions of other countries have shaped American international behavior. Topics considered include terrorism, nuclear proliferation, globalization, democracy promotion, whether the rich US has an obligation to help the less fortunate, how much power the Pentagon should have, what role the private sector can and should play in advancing American interests, and the Bush revolution in foreign policy. A central aim of the course is to map competing perspectives so that the student can draw his or her own political conclusions. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(International Relations and Foreign Policy)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>French Foreign Policy</strong><br />
In this course we will focus on the foreign policy of Fifth Republic France (1958-Present).  In the first part, we will study the role of Charles de Gaulle in defining the place of France in the world after the liberation and in establishing the major tenets of French foreign policy.  In the second part, we will examine the evolution of French foreign policy by focusing on three main themes: (1) the relationship of France with its former colonies; (2) transatlantic relations; and (3) European integration.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Frontiers in Political Science Research</strong><br />
Nothing is more controversial among political scientists than the topic of how to study politics.  In this course, we consider a variety of advanced techniques for studying political phenomena, including statistical methods, game theory, institutional analysis, case study techniques, experiments, and agent-based modeling.  We will work with concrete examples (drawn from major political science journals) of how scholars have used these techniques, and consider the ongoing philosophical controversies associated with each approach.  Students will have the opportunity to conduct original research using a method and subject of their choosing.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>International Relations of East Asia</strong><br />
Although the power of East Asian states makes the region central to US foreign policy and the study of international politics in general, most international relations theorists rely heavily upon European history and case studies. In this course, we will explore IR theory and East Asian politics in an attempt to enrich both. We will review major events in East Asia, explore advanced theoretical readings and their applications to the region, and finally, use these theories to understand issues like energy security, territorial disputes, and prospects for democratic development.

How do candidates for political office choose their platforms? Why do some conflicts lead to war while others do not? What legislation will legislators introduce? These and many other compelling questions of political behavior often use game theory as a tool to study strategic, or interdependent, decision-making. Students will learn basic concepts of game theory and how to apply them to a range of political phenomena. To succeed, students need only a solid background in algebra.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Seminar on Comparative Democratization</strong><br />
This seminar explores critical issues concerning transitions from authoritarian to democratic rule. It addresses such questions as: What factors account for the "third wave" of global democratic expansion? How do newly democratic societies confront their authoritarian past? Should the new leaders choose presidential or parliamentary government? What challenges confront states that are undergoing simultaneously processes of democratic change and economic transformation? What conditions favor consolidation of new democracies? Can democracy's "third wave" be sustained indefinitely, or will a wave of democratic breakdowns follow? To contend with such questions, we will analyze and compare the experience of many countries and regions. (One course in comparative politics) 3 hrs. sem. <br />

Sub-Saharan Africa has been described as being in a state of permanent crisis, a place where disorder and chaos reign and states are chronically weak. How do political systems form and thrive under such conditions? What accounts for their survival in the face of tremendous political, economic, and environmental challenges? We will investigate the distinctive characteristics of African political systems, the different governance models throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and the types of public goods or public ills these systems have produced. We will also have the opportunity to more deeply appreciate the real-life consequences for displaced Africans through a service-learning component. 3 hrs. sem. (Comparative Politics)]]></description>

In this course we will survey the central questions in studies of political Islam, focusing on the emergence of Islam as a political force in the contemporary period.  Discussion will center on the following core topics: (1) the nature of political Islam and Islamic interests; (2) how Islamic political movements develop; (3) why Islamic political movements flourish or fail; (4) how Islamic interests are expressed in the political arena; and (5) what types of political systems are most compatible with politicized Islam? These questions will be addressed by looking at the general history of the contemporary Islamic resurgence and by examining case studies on Egypt, Algeria, Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. 3 hrs. sem.  <em>(Comparative Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Chinese Political Economy</strong><br />
Over the past 30 years China has undergone a tremendous transition. The purpose of this course is to consider the extent to which China's experience has challenged theories of market reform. First, we will examine the role of the state in Chinese economic development and market systems more broadly. Second, we will analyze challenges in Chinese state-society relations, from public service provision to protest, that have emerged after such rapid economic growth. Finally, we will discuss the political implications of the Chinese state's responses to these issues in terms of authoritarian durability and governance. 3 hrs. sem. <em>(Comparative Politics)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Political Economy of Regionalism *<br />
In this course we will address the political economy of regionalism in a variety of national and regional contexts.  We will consider both integration projects—such as the European Union and South America’s Mercosur—as well as subnational local autonomy movements, such as those in Catalonia and Scotland.  We will study theories of integration as well as case studies from Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, focusing on the political and economic forces driving both integration and disintegration in their historical and contemporary contexts.  We will also consider how globalization affects regional integration projects. /(Comparative Politics)/ 3 hrs. sem.</strong>]]></description>

What makes an individual “abnormal”?   Under what circumstances do mental health professionals classify emotions, thoughts, or behaviors as “disordered”?  In this course, we will explore these questions with attention to their historical, theoretical, ethical, and diagnostic implications.  We will investigate various classes of disorders, like anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders, with a focus on their causes and treatments.  Throughout, we will aim to appreciate the complexities and uncertainties surrounding diagnosis, and to recognize and challenge common assumptions about psychological disorders.  In addition to lecture, the course will include discussions of current and controversial topics, and occasional demonstrations, analysis of clinical case material, and/or role plays.

Remarkably, using just five basic senses, our brains translate simple external stimuli (e.g. light and sound waves) into unique and vivid perceptual experiences enabling us to interact with our surrounding physical reality.  Focusing primarily on the underlying mechanisms of vision and audition, we will explore how our brains construct detailed representations of our world.  Throughout these explorations, we will identify perceptual limitations and investigate how mental processes such as attention and emotion affect our perceptions.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong><br />
Questions about the nature of the mind, thinking, and knowledge have a long and rich history in the field of psychology. This course will examine the theoretical perspectives and empirically documented phenomena that inform our current understanding of cognition. Lectures, discussions, demonstrations, and experiments will form the basis for our explorations of cognition in this class. Topics to be considered include attention, perception, memory, knowledge, problem solving, and decision making. (PSYC 0105; PSYC 0201 or MATH 0116 or ECON 0210 previously or concurrently; PSYC 0202 recommended; not open to first-year students; open to psychology and neuroscience majors; others by waiver) 3 hrs. lect./1.5 hrs. lab.]]></description>

In this course students will explore current research and theory on the interrelated domains of social and emotional development from infancy through adulthood. Families and peers serve as the primary relationships for children’s and adolescents’ socialization, and relationships will be explored to further understand how they influence emotion regulation, adaptation to stressful life events, and intrapersonal conflicts. Emphasis will be placed on the role of context and culture in the formation of social and emotional competencies and experiences.  We will explore the theory and practice of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) curricula to enhance individuals’ social and emotional skills.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Approaches to Clinical Psychology: Theory and Practice</strong><br />
What are the major theoretical orientations of clinical psychology, and how does each view the domains of thinking, behavior, free will, psychopathology, and treatment?  We will explore cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, behaviorist, existential, and other approaches to clinical psychology.  Each has its own emphasis; some focus on symptoms, while others teach emotional tolerance or address unconscious drives. Using philosophy, theory, evidence, and case examples, we will explore similarities and differences among the major orientations and consider their consequences for researchers, therapists, and society at large. (PSYC 0224 recommended; open to junior/senior psychology majors; others by approval.) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Environmental Problems and Human Behavior</strong><br />
We live in the Anthropocene – a time defined by human dominance over nature.   Most people report caring about the environment, yet there is a large disconnect between attitudes and actions. Over the semester we will examine: (1) the state of the environment and how personal perceptions of nature have led to this situation, (2) the psychological levers that motivate pro-environmental behaviors (or not), (3) the extent to which different modes of messaging and feedback serve to shift individuals’ behavior, (4) the underpinnings of framing and decision making around individual environmental choices and policy support, and (5) the psychological benefits of spending time in nature. We will explore psychology's understanding of wellbeing, consumerism, community, and nature. By the end of the semester we should be able to offer, based on the psychological research, suggestions for personal and policy changes to increase sustainability on campus and beyond.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Lenses on Sex and Gender</strong><br />
Where do sex and gender come from, and what difference do they make?  In this course we will address these questions using social psychological and neuroscientific/hormonal perspectives. We will investigate gender identity, stereotyping, and power, and will explore issues of sex and gender in multiple contexts, including childhood socialization and play, sexual orientation and attraction, close relationships and affiliation, cognition, the workplace, and mental health. Students will learn to think critically about these issues as portrayed in academic and popular discourse. (PSYC 0105; Open to junior and senior psychology; neuroscience; and gender, sexuality, and feminist studies majors only; not open to students who have taken PSYC/GSFS 0330) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Ten Commandments</strong><br />
After a grounding in the narratives of Genesis and Exodus (and an examination of those books’ understanding of the Law) we will move on to study the two versions of the Commandments—one in Exodus and one in Deuteronomy. We will then proceed to the history of interpretation of the Commandments, both as a unit unto themselves and as part of the general system of biblical law. Special attention will be paid to the differences between Rabbinic Judaism's understanding of the Decalogue (as the commandments are also known) and the various Christian understandings of the Ten Commandments. We will also look at expressions of the Decalogue in Islamic scripture and tradition. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

What is Islam? Is it a religion, a way of life, a civilization, or a political ideology? Was Muhammad a political leader, a warrior, or an ascetic? What is the Qur’an? How did it develop as a sacred text and how does it compare to the Bible? This course is designed to provide a platform for us to explore such questions by focusing on historical, social, and intellectual developments in the wide swath of land known as the Muslim world. Special attention will be given to early developments of the Islamic community as well as the later response of different Muslim communities to modernity. 2 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc]]></description>

This course is designed to provide a platform for us to explore such questions by focusing on historical, social, and intellectual developments in the wide swath of land known as the Muslim world.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Jewish Tradition</strong><br />
How did monotheism emerge in the ancient Middle East? What did God command the Jews to do? (And when God spoke, were they already Jews?)  How did they transform this message into a tradition that has endured over two millennia?  In this course we will study the tension between preservation and innovation in the Jewish tradition by exploring ritual, practice, classical texts, and their interpretations: Bible, Mishnah, Talmud, Midrash, medieval philosophy (Maimonides), poetry (Halevi), and mysticism (Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah). 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

America often has been defined paradoxically as both the "most religious" and "least religious" of nations. This course, a historical survey of American religious life, will trace the unique story of American religion from colonial times to the present. Guiding our exploration will be the ideas of "contact," "conflict," and "combination." Along the way, we will examine the varieties of religious experiences and traditions that have shaped and been shaped by American culture such as, Native American traditions, Puritan life and thought, evangelicalism, immigration, African-American religious experience, women's movements, and the on-going challenges of religious diversity.  Readings include sermons, essays, diaries and fiction, as well as secondary source material.  2 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Persecution and Revival of Religion in Modern China</strong><br />
In this study of the dramatic recent religious history of China, we will begin with "modern" critics and reformers at the end of the imperial era and then consider the communist suppression of religion and the "cult of Mao." Our focus, however, will be the remarkable revival of religion since Mao's death in 1976. We will investigate the activity itself-ranging from traditional practices to new religious movements to various forms of Christianity—and the complex cultural and political dynamics involved in this "return" to religion. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Christianity in Africa</strong><br />
Christianity has an ancient heritage in Africa and a vibrant presence today, especially in the form of charismatic and Pentecostal movements which emphasize divine healing and prophecy.  In this course we will examine the texts, beliefs, and individuals who shaped early Christianity in northern Africa and Ethiopia, with emphasis on monasticism, martyrdom, and the writings of Augustine of Hippo.  Then we will examine cross-cultural contact with European Christians, including Roman Catholic and Protestant missionary encounters.  We will examine issues of racism, sexism, and cultural superiority past and present, to help us understand the complex role of religion and belief in the supernatural in post-colonial Africa today. 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the rise of Religious Zionism in Israel, Middle Eastern politics and religion have become inextricably linked. In this course we examine the relationship between politics and religion in  the Arab states, Israel, and Iran.  Readings include selections from the scriptures of the monotheistic traditions, historical accounts of religious and political change, and theoretical analyses of historical trends. Throughout the term we will follow news accounts of current developments in the Middle East. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Privilege and Poverty: The Ethics of Economic Inequality</strong><br />
In this course we will study the ethical implications of domestic and global economic inequality.  Drawing from history, economics, sociology, philosophy, theology, and other disciplines, we will examine the causes and consequences of inequality, critically evaluate our usage of the terms “privilege” and “poverty,” and consider the range of moral responses individuals and society might have to inequality.  We will ask whether it is unfair, unfortunate, or necessary that some citizens live with significantly less material wealth than others, and whether those who experience “privilege” have any moral responsibility to those who exist in “poverty.”]]></description>

In this seminar we will examine lives of Jesus from the earliest gospels to contemporary novels, tracing how changing times result in changing views. Though focusing on literature, we will also look at the ways artists of each period portray Jesus—including representations in contemporary cinema. From the earliest period we will look at a variety of gospels (Mark, John, Thomas, and the Protoevangelium of James); from late antiquity and the medieval world we will consider Augustine’s harmony of the gospels, the Gospel of Nicodemus, and examples of narrative art; the latter part of the course will focus on the “quest of the historical Jesus” and recent responses to it. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

In this seminar we will examine the genesis of the academic study of religion in the modern world by reading seminal texts of such founding thinkers as: Durkheim, Weber, James, Freud, Jung, and Eliade. We will analyze these and more recent theories and methods in the sociological, psychological, and comparative study of religion, discerning their assumptions and implications, strengths and weaknesses, and utilizing them in focused written assignments. We end with the study of text-critical methods, interpreting the Garden of Eden story from multiple perspectives. Open to juniors and seniors who have had two religion courses or by waiver. 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Archaeology</strong><br />
Archaeology is the scientific analysis and interpretation of cultural remains. Archaeologists examine artifacts, architecture, and even human remains in order to answer questions about the growth and development of societies worldwide.  In addressing these issues we not only illuminate the past but also explore patterns relevant to contemporary social concerns.  From the tropical lowlands of Central America to the deserts of ancient Egypt, this course provides an introduction to world prehistory.  We proceed from humanity's earliest beginnings to the development of complex societies worldwide and use case examples to explore the major topics, methods, and theories of contemporary archaeology. 2 hrs. lect./1 hr. lab. (Anthropology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction to Sociology of Gender</strong><br />
What is gender and what would a sociology of it look like? When did gender become a category of inquiry and more importantly why? We will look at how the meaning and performance of gender changed over time, from Classical Greece to Victorian England, to the contemporary U.S. We will also look at how gender changes depending on one’s position in social space, e.g. one’s race, class, sexuality, and nationality. Finally, we will consider how the need to look at gender is the result of a variety of discourses, from psychoanalysis to capitalism to movements of liberation such as feminism. 3 hrs. lect. (Sociology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sociology of Education</strong><br />
In this course we will study education both as a social institution and as a social process. In our analysis of education and its relationship to the structure of society, we will pay particular attention to the intersection of gender, class, race, and ethnicity within schools. Our objective will be to explore the ways in which education might contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities, as well as its potential for social change. The substantive focus will be on American society. Limited places available for students to satisfy the college writing requirement. 3 hrs. lect. (Sociology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Anthropology of Continuity and Change in sub-Saharan Africa</strong><br />
Africa has long represented primitive mysteries for Europeans and North Americans who perceived it as a "Dark Continent" full of exotic people and animals.   Even now, many Americans learn little about Africa and Africans except for ‘thin’ media reports of political, economic, and ecological upheaval or persistent poverty, disease, and despair.  This course provides a ‘thick’ description and analysis of contemporary African conditions using ethnographies, films, and literature.   Our focus will be on understanding both continuity and change, cultural diversity, and commonality. (Not open to students who have taken SOAN 0332) 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(Anthropology)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>State and Society in Contemporary Israel</strong><br />
In this course we will examine Israeli society and politics in a period of rapid and profound transformation.  We will begin with an introductory unit on Zionism, Palestinian nationalism, and the history of the state. Subsequent units will examine the social, cultural, and political characteristics of Israel’s main population sectors (European, Middle Eastern, Russian, and Ethiopian Jews and Palestinian citizens of the state) and religious groupings (Muslims and Jews, including secular, traditional, national-religious, and ultra-Orthodox). The final units will examine ongoing political struggles that will shape the future of the state, including struggles over the role of religion in public life; civil rights and democracy; and West Bank settlements and the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. Most readings assignments will be social scientific or historical in nature, but will also include some journalism and literature. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Visual Sociology</strong><br />
We live in a visual world. To understand society and culture, we must understand the images we produce and consume. This course provides a sociological lens to study how we use and are used by images. We will study key theories that frame how visual contents (such as photographs, films, and videos) are shared, viewed, and interpreted by various audiences. Using images as our starting point, we will analyze the messages and imagery in visual texts to extract their social meanings. We will engage three sides of visual sociology: images as cultural artifacts, picture making as data collection, and displaying research visually.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Traveling in (and out of) the Holy Land: Israeli Tourism</strong><br />
Tourism is one of the most salient cultural phenomena in the post-World War II era and a main feature of modern life. In this course we will approach tourism from the Israeli perspective. Located at the juncture of Asia, Africa, and Europe and the birthplace of the three monotheistic religions, "The Holy Land", is an important site of pilgrimage and tourism. The diverse landscapes, pleasant weather, varied ethnic mosaic, Middle Eastern cuisine, and vibrant night life further contribute to the country's appeal. Yet Israel is also a hotspot of political disputes and the site of one of the longest standing conflicts of our era, scaring away many tourists, yet attracting others—interested in different kinds of "dark-tourism". Israelis themselves are big travelers, roaming the world individually and on tour-groups, carrying along their cultural traits and behavioral patterns. The lectures and readings for this course will outline the contemporary social theory of tourism and will analyze touristic practices in and of Israel and the Israelis.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Globalization and Its Discontents</strong><br />
In this course we will explore one of the most fundamental dynamics of our time-globalization. Underlying so many changes in our economic, political, and cultural lives, globalization has transformed our world in innumerable ways. Nonetheless, debates about the nature of these processes and outcomes are largely unresolved and often completely misunderstood. In this survey course we will examine particular themes related to the general concept of globalization: transnational civil society and social movements, economic development, postmodernism, global governance. We will read from sources across the academic disciplines and make use of journalism, film, and popular nonfiction. 3 hrs. lect. (Sociology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Diasporas and Homelands</strong><br />
War, mass migration, and globalization have spurred development of diaspora communities and heightened scholarly interest in the phenomenon.  In contrast to other groups of exiles and immigrants, diaspora communities seek integration within host countries as well as ongoing political, economic, and cultural ties to their homelands. A number of questions arise from these complex and dynamic relationships: How do diaspora communities maintain cultural distinctiveness within host countries? How do they maintain and reproduce cultural ties with homelands and other centers of diaspora life? What influence do diaspora communities have on political relationships between host countries and homelands? What influence do they have on internal homeland politics? Finally, what are the implications of the diaspora phenomenon for the future of the nation state and globalization? Case studies will be drawn from a variety of diaspora communities, including Armenians, Nigerians, Jews, Palestinians, Dominicans, and South Asians. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Deviance and Social Control</strong> <br />
This course will introduce students to sociological perspectives on the nature, causes and control of deviant behavior and populations. We will consider, historically and theoretically, the construction of deviance, the social purpose it serves, and the societal response deviance engenders. We will pay special attention to the ways in which the deviant body is constructed and managed through a variety of frameworks – including medical, punitive and therapeutic - and reflect critically on the social and political ramifications of the categorizations “deviant” and “normal”. 3 hrs. lect./disc. (Sociology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Gender, Culture, and Power</strong><br />
This course offers a cross-cultural introduction to the issues involved in the study of women and gender.  Such an endeavor raises a number of difficult and delicate issues.  What explains the diversities and similarities in women's roles across societies?  How do we assess women's status and power, and how do we decide which standards to use in doing so?  What forces create changes in women's roles?  What is the relationship between gender constructions and the nature of communities, economies, and even nations?  Our analysis will concentrate on three primary domains: family and kinship, symbolic systems, and political economy. Course readings will focus primarily on non-Western societies.  3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(Anthropology)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Topics in Sociological Theory</strong><br />
This course provides an overview of major lines of development in 20th century social theory relevant to the field of sociology, focusing on how various theorists have grappled with the basic issues that have dominated 20th century social thought. Particular attention will be given to the questions arising from the conceptual distinctions between structure and action, on the one hand, and identity and culture, on the other. How is social order possible? How autonomous are human agents? How do we explain the persistence of observed patterns of human interaction and social practice? How do we analyze relations between the world of everyday life and the large-scale development of social systems? How does social change take place? (SOAN 0103 or SOAN 0105) 3 hrs. lect. (Sociology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Idea of Drugs and Addiction</strong><br />
Drugs cause panic and social hysteria.  We spend time talking about them and expend energy distinguishing between good and bad drugs and users.  Movies, documentaries, literature, art, and television shows reflect this preoccupation with the use and misuse of drugs. In this course we will  investigate the social significance of “drugs” as a cultural, rather than pharmacological, category. We will consider drugs and addiction as <em>ideas</em> that reflect concerns about the “self” in modernity. We will examine the panic surrounding drug use and addiction, our preoccupation with treatment, and our emphasis on sobriety.  Overall, we will engage with the larger themes the idea of drugs and addiction raises: harm, exclusion, inequality, pleasure, freedom, desire, perfection, enlightenment, and control. 3hrs. lect./disc. (SOAN 0105 or SOAN 0288) (Sociology)]]></description>

In this course we will approach Native North America and the American political mainstream as dynamically intertwined. Through ethnography, ethno-history, oral literature, and indigenous film we will examine the history of colonial encounters between the Indigenous and the 'Western'. We will examine how indigenous cultural difference and moral claims to land have challenged dominant political cultures across the history of the North American settler states. Our analysis will extend to ongoing questions concerning cultural knowledge, sustainability, and imagined futures. 3 hrs. sem. (Anthropology)]]></description>

This course centers around the rise and fall of the Aztecs, the first state-level society encountered by the Spanish in 1519.  Although primarily known today for their military exploits for what today is Mexico, the Aztecs produced great artisans, artists, and philosophers whose contributions endure in contemporary Mexican culture. We will trace the origins and development of Aztec civilization to its encounter with the Spanish in 1519.  The course also covers the Spanish background for the Conquest, from the martial and political expulsion of Moors and Jews from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492 to the Spanish Inquisition. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(Anthropology)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Anthropology of International Labor Migration</strong><br />
Do the inhabitants of low-income countries have a human right to compete for jobs in high-income countries? Millions of Latin Americans and other peoples of the Global South perceive that their only chance for a better life is moving to a high-income country.  Meanwhile, millions of Americans and Europeans fear that rising numbers of migrants will take their jobs and change their countries beyond recognition. This course will focus on international labor migration, the social forces that increase it, and the implications for sending and receiving communities.  We will apply ethnographic research to debates over borderlands, remittance economies, low-wage labor markets, and immigration policies, with a focus on Latin American migration to the U.S., African migration to Europe, and South Asian migration to the Middle East. (Not open to students who have taken FYSE 1287 or SOAN 1021) 3 hrs. lect./disc. (Anthropology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Anthropology of International Labor Migration</strong><br />
Do the inhabitants of low-income countries have a human right to compete for jobs in high-income countries? Millions of Latin Americans and other peoples of the Global South perceive that their only chance for a better life is moving to a high-income country.  Meanwhile, millions of Americans and Europeans fear that rising numbers of migrants will take their jobs and change their countries beyond recognition. This course will focus on international labor migration, the social forces that increase it, and the implications for sending and receiving communities.  We will apply ethnographic research to debates over borderlands, remittance economies, low-wage labor markets, and immigration policies, with a focus on Latin American migration to the U.S., African migration to Europe, and South Asian migration to the Middle East. (Not open to students who have taken FYSE 1287 or SOAN 1021) 3 hrs. lect./disc. (Anthropology)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Global Japanese Culture - In English</strong><br />
In this course we will examine the transformation of Japanese cultural identity (Japanese-ness) as products, ideas, and people move across the borders in and out of Japan. Social scientists have been particularly interested in the Japanizing of non-Japanese practices and products such as hip hop and hamburgers, as well as the popularity of Japanese styles and products on the global scene. We will take an anthropological approach using texts such as <em>Millennial Monsters</em>, <em>Remade in Japan</em>, and <em>Hip Hop Japan</em> to examine the issues of cultural hybridity, identity, and globalization.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Gender, Adolescents, and Violence</strong><br />
Violence in young people’s environments, and fear of it, shape their experiences and coping strategies. Adolescents spend the majority of their time in two environments—the neighborhood and school. How does violence at home and at school affect adolescents’ responses to danger? In this course we will examine how adolescents’ “fight or flight” responses to violence in school—i.e., whether they isolate from or confront violence—partly depend on the overlapping versus conflicting norms they encounter at school and in the neighborhood, as well as due to their gender. 3 hrs. lect./disc. <em>(Sociology)/</em>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>The Continuing Significance of Race in the United States</strong><br />
This course will introduce students to theories of race and racism in the United States, how racial categories are formed and maintained in a variety of social arenas, and how race and racism influence social systems. In order to demonstrate the prevalence of race and racism in the U.S., the course will be a “topics” course in that each week, we will explore a different topic (such as education, crime, gender) and examine how they are influenced by race and racism. In addition, the course will compare and contrast the experiences of different racial and ethnic groups in the United States and examine how these different experiences influences the way they are seen, how they see themselves, and how they interact with other groups. Upon completion of the course, students will have a better understanding of the historic and contemporary significance of race and how race influences our everyday interactions in multiple different social arenas. 3 hrs. lect.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Anthropology of Corruption</strong><br />
In this course we will explore the wide variety of human exchange practices glossed under the term “corruption”, such as Nigerian e-mail scams to American election financing and petty bribes in North India. We will use classic anthropological theories of bureaucracy, gift exchange, and patron-clientism to understand the ubiquity of these practices, with close attention to how they are related to structures of power. We will also critically examine popular writing about corruption. (Prior coursework in SOAN recommended) 3 hrs. lect./disc. (Anthropology)]]></description>

In this course we will consider the range of family forms (including living alone) that exist in the United States and evaluate how social policy shapes the dynamics of different types of families.  We will be particularly attentive to variations in experience by gender, age, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, citizenship, and social class. Although the focus will be on contemporary United States, we will also examine some cross-cultural and historical material. (SOAN 0105 or SOAN 0212) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Language and Power Seminar</strong><br />
This seminar is an introduction to both linguistic anthropology and political anthropology.  Communication patterns are always mediated by cultural processes, social inequality, and power, so in this course we will investigate cross-cultural examples of how language, discourse, and representation relate to inequality, power, and resistance.  Topics will include sociolinguistics, ethnolinguistics, gendered language practices, political discourse, and theoretical approaches to power (Marx, Foucault, and Bourdieu) (SOAN 0103 or SOAN 0105) 3 hrs. sem. (Anthropology)]]></description>

In this course we will study the sound system of Spanish with the aims of introducing the fields of phonetics and phonology while improving pronunciation. Students will become familiar with phonetic transcription, comparing and contrasting articulatory and acoustic characteristics of Spanish as well as English in order to understand and implement different phonological patterns produced by native speakers of Spanish. Additionally, we will discuss major pronunciation differences across the Spanish-speaking world. (SPAN 0220 or placement) 3 hrs. lect./disc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Reading and Writing the New U.S. Latino Narrative</strong><br />
This course focuses on a new generation of U.S.-Latino authors writing about migration, identity, and otherness. They distinguish themselves from prior generations by publishing primarily in Spanish and by a new sense of ownership of their U.S. environment, which allows them to play with and undermine assumptions commonly associated with their "Latino" identity. In addition to studying these authors, students will produce at least two fiction pieces of their own. Satisfies the IS advanced language requirement in Spanish.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics</strong><br />
How has psychoanalysis shaped art? In this course we will interpret Hispanic fiction, poetry, film, and arts from a psychoanalytic perspective. Psychoanalysis has been an influential discourse in literary and artistic criticism in the 20th century. In the Hispanic world, Freud and his theories of the mind, often channeled through surrealism, have inspired artists and critics to explore desire, language, and image in revolutionary ways. We will study narrative (Hernández, Lamborghini, Levrero, Piñera, Bellatin, etc.) and poetry (Generación del 27, César Moro, and others), with a minor focus on film (Buñuel) and art. Psychoanalytic theory will include Freud, Jung, Lacan, Kristeva, Felman and/or Žižek. (At least two Spanish courses at the 0300-level or above, or by waiver)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Marxism in Latin America</strong><br />
What is Latin American Marxism? The writings of Karl Marx constitute a foundational discourse, which has given rise to many interpretations. Through readings in political philosophy, history, and study of literature and film, we will explore the trajectories of the Socialist and Communist parties; proposals to imagine a specifically Latin American route to an egalitarian society; and the Liberation Theology movement, which couples Catholic and Marxist thought. Readings will include works by: Marx, Azuela, Eisenstein, Mariátegui, Trotsky, Maroff, Castro, Frei Betto, and García Linera. (Spanish Majors, must take at least two courses of level 0350 or above, or by waiver) 3 hrs. sem.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Dramatizing the Black Experience for the American Stage</strong><br />
In this course we will explore how influential contemporary African American dramatists bring to the American stage different aspects of the black experience.  From William Branch’s A Medal For Willie (1951) to Dominique Morisseau’s Detroit ’67 (2013), readings will provide students the opportunity to investigate how plays are interpreted by actors and directors, and wrestle with topics such as voting rights, cultural appropriation, housing discrimination, gender inequality, and equal access to education.  Beyond dramatic texts and critical readings, students will hear some of the playwrights (via video conferencing) offer their views on topics and issues we will discuss in class. 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

Using the Linklater technique for the voice, students will study the physiological foundations of voice and alignment. By means of interrelated physical and vocal exercises, students will discover ways of changing patterns that restrict a full range of physical and vocal expressiveness. Students will study and present passages from Shakespeare to explore ways in which their new physical and vocal skills may be used to express a greater range of intellectual and emotional understanding.

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Theatre History</strong><br />
Using the dramatic text as the primary focus, this course will chart the progression of theatre from its ritualistic origins to the advent of modern drama. This survey will include an overview of theatrical architecture, the evolution of design and acting styles, and the introduction of the director. Since theatre does not exist in a void, a consideration of the social, cultural, political, and scientific milieu of each era studied will be included in the course. 2 1/2 hrs. lect./discussion & 1 screening per week]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Directing and Creating: Textual Work and Devised Work</strong><br />
In recent years the disciplines of directing ‘text-based’ theatre and of creating (or devising) a theatre piece without an initial reliance on a text have built shared approaches to material. Devised work may be composed through vocal or physical improvisation, created through interviews, or collaged from various sources, a text may emerge during the process. Text-based theatre is more traditional in its impetus, but the process of fleshing out a text can be very similar to creating without a text.  In this course we will approach both forms of theatre, creating and directing pieces in many forms, and viewing works. Readings include The Viewpoints Book, The Active Text, and The Frantic Assembly Book of Devising Theatre. The course is suggested for actors and designers as well as directors and may be used to fulfill a requirement for senior work in directing or devising. This course is not open to students who have taken THEA 0237 or THEA 0324. (THEA 0102 or THEA 0214 or THEA 0218) 3 hrs. lect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<strong>Twentieth/Twenty-first Century Performance Aesthetics</strong><br />
This course is an intensive exploration of the evolution of the theory and practice of theatrical experimentation in the 20th and 21st centuries. The Modernist movement irrevocably altered the artist’s relationship to the social, and political order. The ramifications of this change will be addressed throughout the course, with particular emphasis on Brecht, Artaud, and Grotowski. Students will write papers and give presentations on the work of such contemporary artists as Peter Brook, DV8, Robert Wilson, Ariane Mnouchkine, Complicite and Jerzy Grotowski. (Approval required; ARDV 0116 and THEA 0208) 3 hrs. lect./1 hr. disc.]]></description>
